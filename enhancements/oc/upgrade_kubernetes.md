# Upgrading oc to latest version of Kubernetes with gomod

1. Explicitly opt into go modules, even though we are inside a `GOPATH` directory,
   otherwise the default auto mechanism turns on, which when it notices vendor
   directory will turn go modules off.
   ```
   export GO111MODULE=on
   ```
2. Get desired version of apimachinery, client-go, cli-runtime, kubectl and kubernetes (eg. 1.17.0).
3. Create branch `oc-A.B-kubernetes-X.Y.Z` (where A.B is the oc version, and X.Y.Z is the kubernetes version)
   in apimachinery, client-go, cli-runtime, kubectl and kubernetes and prime the repos with the basic
   state from k8s (see previous step).
4. Open a PR in openshift/release to add this new branch of openshift/kubernetes, [similar to this](https://github.com/openshift/release/pull/6349)
   Usually, you can copy the last version's `release/ci-operator/config/openshift/kubernetes/*` file to a new file that reflects the new branch name, 
   verify the go version used, then `make jobs` to generate the new job. 
5. Pick carry patches. From each openshift/kubernetes-repository, `git log --no-merges --oneline openshift/oc-4.4-kubernetes-1.17.0`
   is a handful query where `openshift` is the name of the remote pointing to `openshift/kubernetes-repo` 
   (replace versions from previous query accordingly). For the `UPSTREAM` commits, you need
   to verify what kind of patches were applied to the last kubernetes bump (1.16.2 here) and create a 
   [spreadsheet similar to this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VQw_B2Nfqg9ILKvoNLK0YQdiM2LUidOX7Q-wRKBlrSE/edit?usp=sharing)
   to decide whether we still need a patch or not.  
6. For each repository (apimachinery, client-go, cli-runtime, kubectl), open A PR with the picked commits from the
   spreadsheet against the oc-A.B-kubernetes-X.Y.Z branch.
7. In openshift/kubernetes repository, check out the new oc-A.B-kubernetes-X.Y.X branch and:
   1. Add the replace dependency for openshift/api and openshift/client-go pointing at latest SHA from that repo, eg.
      ```
      github.com/openshift/api => github.com/openshift/api master
      ```
   2. Run `go list -m all` which will turn above line in go.mod into something like:
      ```
      github.com/openshift/api v3.9.1-0.20190822120857-58aab2885e38+incompatible // indirect
      ```
   3. Copy and paste the changes from apimachinery, client-go, cli-runtime and kubectl PRs above into kubernetes/staging/src/k8s.io/ directory,
      and use git add *.go because we care only about go files.  This is a manual step, You can use curl like so for each file to copy file 
      changes from your PRs above:
      ```
      cd staging/src/k8s.io/repo
      curl -o path/to/file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.....
      ```
   4. Run `hack/update-vendor.sh` to pick up openshift dependencies
   5. Commit the changes, then open a PR against the openshift/kubernetes oc-A.B-kubernetes-X.Y.Z branch.
      Confirm the openshift/release change from step 4 is merged and the unit test is triggered in your PR. 
8. In oc repository: 
   1. Edit the replace dependencies to point to the commits from the merged PRs from previous steps.
   2. Edit the replace dependencies for all other k8s.io/repos to point to latest release (`release-1.17` here).
      It's useful to add a commit for steps 1,2.
   3. Run `go mod vendor`, `go mod tidy` and verify the changes before committing.
   3. Update kubectl version fields injected in Makefile (using `git describe --long --tags --abbrev=7` in kubernetes fork).
   4. Run `make` and `make test-unit` and fix whatever is broken.
9. Update this document with latest versions, spreadsheet, anything else to help the next bump go smoothly.

## Useful `gomod` commands

* `go mod init` creates a new module, initializing the go.mod file that describes it.
* `go build`, `go test`, and other package-building commands add new dependencies to go.mod as needed.
* `go list -m all` prints the current moduleâ€™s dependencies.
* `go get` changes the required version of a dependency (or adds a new dependency).
* `go mod tidy` removes unused dependencies.
* `go mod why -m` and/or `go mod graph` to learn about why a certain version was picked and how/where from
