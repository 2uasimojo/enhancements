*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Merged pull requests:

- [1158](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1158): (3/362) general: Stateless Ingress node firewall support using eBPF proposal (msherif1234) ([SDN-2781](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-2781))

  > OCP customers would like to secure OCP's nodes from external attacks by configuring ingress firewall policies.
  > eBPF provides a very flexible filtering mechanism to allow early detection and filtering.
  > eXpress Data Path (XDP) is a feature in the Linux kernel which allows users to execute a user-supplied eBPF program when a packet is received on a network interface (NIC).
  > This program is executed in the NICâ€™s device driver, right after the interrupt processing and before the network stack.
  > The goal of XDP is to offer comparable performance to kernel bypass solutions while working with the existing kernel networking stack.
  > A new cluster-scoped object `IngressNodeFirewall` will be used to configure node ingress firewall match rules and per rule statistics will be available.
  > Admin can provision multiple instances of this object while ensuring certain execution order.
  > For the best performance XDP programs need to attach to interfaces using the following models:
  > - Native XDP \
  >   The XDP program is loaded by the network card driver as part of its initial receive path. This also requires support from the network card driver.
  > - Offloaded XDP \
  >   The XDP program loads directly on the NIC, and executes without using the CPU. This also requires support from the network interface device.
  > For NICs drivers that doesn't support native XDP performance will degrade while still be better that using linux iptables tools.

### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 New pull requests:

- [1275](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1275): (8/8) microshift: Update CSI user config workflow  (copejon) ([USHIFT-41](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/USHIFT/issues/USHIFT-41))

  > This enhancement proposes the adoption of a
  > default [Container Storage Interface(CSI) Plugin](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/)for Microshift. For more
  > details on MicroShift, see the respective [proposal](./kubernetes-for-device-edge.md). Kubernetes' CSI implementation
  > provides a standardized model for exposing block and file storage systems to container workloads.

- [1276](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1276): (2/2) installer: Add support for custom DNS on AWS (sadasu)

  > This enhancement adds the ability to use a pre-configured custom DNS solution
  > for API Server and Ingress resolution on the AWS platform during OpenShift
  > IPI installation on that platform.

- [1277](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1277): (12/12) installer: vSphere: zonal with external lb (jcpowermac) ([OCPPLAN-9652](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-9652))

  > The goal of this enhancement is to provide the ability to install vSphere IPI zonal on separate L2 segments without the static pods (keepalived, haproxy, coredns).
  > As of this writing the only way to accomplish this is to allow an external load balancer.
