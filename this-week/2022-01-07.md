- [949](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/949): (14/81) general: HELM-258: add enhancement for new namespace-scoped helm repo crd (zonggen)

  > Right now we support [`cluster-scoped` Helm repository CRD](https://github.com/openshift/api/blob/master/helm/v1beta1/0000_10-helm-chart-repository.crd.yaml#L17). This requires admin-level permissions when developers want to add a Helm repository in the OpenShift Console. We would like to add the ability to install Helm repository as a custom resource but with `scope: namespaced`.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Other New pull requests:

- [992](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/992): (8/8) authentication: auth: add enhancement for direct kube-apiserver oidc config (stlaz)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > When users authenticate to OpenShift, the authentication goes through the `oauth-server`
  > which serves as middle-man actor that unifies access to multiple kinds of
  > identity providers, such as LDAP, OIDC providers, providers returning HTTP Basic
  > Authentication challenges, and similar.
  >
  > The above differs from vanilla Kubernetes where authentication is dealt directly
  > by the `kube-apiserver`. This has limitations especially when it comes to being
  > able to login in a uniform manner. On the other hand, `kubectl`, the binary for
  > accessing Kubernetes APIs, has evolved through the years to simplify the login
  > process to Kubernetes clusters, and communities built useful toolings around
  > the binary.

- [994](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/994): (5/5) authentication: auth: add enhancement about pinning SCCs to pods (stlaz)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > Many of the core workloads often rely on running with a specific Security Context Constraint (SCC).
  > However, it ever so often happens that a customer brings an SCC of their own or a 3rd party product.
  > Since SCCs are a complex construct, such a custom SCC often happens to be misshapen and certain fields
  > may cause workloads to break if they depend on SCC defaulting their security contexts.

- [995](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/995): (24/24) machine-api: Add enhancement for AWS Placement Groups in Machine API (JoelSpeed)

  > This enhancement describes the process of integrating [AWS Placement Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#placement-groups-partition)
  > into the OpenShift Machine API.
  >
  > Placement Groups allow users to define how groups of Machines should be placed within the Availability Zone.
  > For example, they can clustered together within the same network spine, or separated for redundancy.

- [996](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/996): (38/38) single-node: Enhancement for enabling single-node-openshift day2 workers expansion (omertuc)

  > This enhancemnet aims to enable adding workers to a single-node cluster by
  > dealing with a "floating ingress" issue encountered "none"-platform single
  > control-plane node clusters which have worker nodes added to them. It does so
  > by adjusting the installer to pin the default `IngressController` to the master
  > pool when installing single-node "none"-platform clusters.
