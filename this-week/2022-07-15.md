### Prioritized New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized New pull request:

- [1187](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1187): (72/72) microshift: kubernetes for industrial edge (dhellmann) ([OCPPLAN-9080](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-9080)) ([USHIFT-50](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-50))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement describes MicroShift, which provides an essential
  > container orchestration runtime compatible with kubernetes and
  > OpenShift built for Internet-of-things (IoT) and Edge computing
  > scenarios that are both CPU and memory constrained.  The container
  > orchestration runtime is binary compatible with OpenShift Container
  > Platform, but it is not 100% API resource compatible.  It has a strict
  > subset of OpenShift API resources pertinent for IoT and Edge computing
  > scenarios with a strong bias to retaining traditional runtime security
  > controls like SecurityContextConstraints and SELinux.
  >
  > Quite a lot of the text in this enhancement is taken from other
  > working documents.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 8 Other New pull requests:

- [1179](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1179): (27/27) network: UPI IP and Interface Selection (cybertron)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > As OpenShift is deployed in increasingly complex networking environments, we
  > have gotten many requests for more control over which interface is used for
  > the primary node IP. We provided a basic mechanism for this with
  > [KUBELET_NODEIP_HINT](https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator/pull/2888)
  > but as users have started to exercise that some significant limitations have
  > come to light.

- [1181](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1181): (10/10) baremetal: Add enhacement for setting bootstrap kubelet ip (tsorya) ([MGMT-11102](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-11102))

  > When installing a new cluster with UPI, you can set machine networks that will
  > be set to `networkConfig` field in the `install-config.yaml` file to configure the control plane network
  > interfaces for the cluster hosts. However, users cannot configure
  > the machine network for the bootstrap node.

- [1184](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1184): (16/16) ingress: NE-586: ingress: Add ReloadInterval Option (Ethany-RH) ([NE-586](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-586))

  > Add an API field to configure OpenShift router's `RELOAD_INTERVAL` environment variable so that administrators can define the minimum frequency the router is allowed to reload to accept new changes.
  >
  > OpenShift router currently hard-codes this reload interval to 5s. It should be possible for administrators to tune this value as necessary. Based on the processes run in the cluster and the frequency that it sees new changes, increasing the minimum interval at which the router is allowed to reload can improve its efficiency.
  > This proposal extends the existing IngressController API to add a tuning option for the reload interval.

- [1188](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1188): (4/4) general: Update mount-namespace-hiding implementation plan to be environment-only (lack) ([CNF-5326](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNF-5326))

  > The current implementation of Kubelet and CRI-O both use the top-level
  > namespace for all container and Kubelet mountpoints. However, moving these
  > container-specific mountpoints into a private namespace reduced systemd
  > overhead with no difference in functionality.

- [1189](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1189): (41/41) installer: Installer: check operators for stability (patrickdillon)

  > This enhancement proposes that the OpenShift Installer should check the status
  > of individual cluster operators and use those statuses as a threshold for
  > determining whether an install is a success (exit 0) or failure (exit != 0).
  > Specifically, the Installer should check whether cluster operators have stopped
  > progressing for a certain amount of time. If the Installer sees that an operator
  > is Available=true but fails to enter a stable Progressing=false state, the Installer
  > will exit non-zero and log an error.
