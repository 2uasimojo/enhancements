### Prioritized New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized New pull request:

- [1237](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1237): (26/26) microshift: Add MicroShift Default CSI Plugin proposal (copejon) ([USHIFT-41](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/USHIFT/issues/USHIFT-41))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes the adoption of a
  > default [Container Storage Interface(CSI) Plugin](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/)for Microshift. For more
  > details on MicroShift, see the respective [proposal](./kubernetes-for-device-edge.md). Kubernetes' CSI implementation
  > provides a standardized model for exposing block and file storage systems to container workloads.


### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized Active pull request:

- [1202](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1202): (1/228) storage: STOR-962: Update storage operators for HyperShift (jsafrane) ([STOR-962](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/STOR-962))

  `lgtm, priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement describes how OCP storage components will run in HyperShift's managed control plane and in the guest
  > cluster.
  >
  > The components currently are:
  >
  > * cluster-csi-snapshot-controller-operator and its operand, csi-snapshot-controller.
  > * cluster-storage operator and its operand aws-ebs-csi-driver-operator and its operand AWS EBS CSI driver.
  >   * All other CSI driver operators + CSI drivers should follow the same approach, AWS EBS is just the first one to
  >     run its control plane in HyperShift's management cluster.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Other Merged pull requests:

- [1179](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1179): (7/93) network: IP and Interface Selection (cybertron) ([OPNET-134](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OPNET-134))

  > As OpenShift is deployed in increasingly complex networking environments, we
  > have gotten many requests for more control over which interface is used for
  > the primary node IP. We provided a basic mechanism for this with
  > [KUBELET_NODEIP_HINT](https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator/pull/2888)
  > but as users have started to exercise that some significant limitations have
  > come to light.


#### Other Merged Pull Requests Modifying Existing Documents

- [1224](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1224): (2/9) dev-guide: Expand Boolean API convention example (JoelSpeed)

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 5 Other New pull requests:

- [1232](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1232): (2/2) installer: installer-aws: create edge compute pool for AWS Local Zones (mtulio) ([RFE-2782](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RFE-2782))

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > The edge adoption is increasing and providers are launching many offerings that fill
  > that area. AWS launched the [Local Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/)
  > and the [Wavelength](https://aws.amazon.com/wavelength/features/) zones to extend the
  > VPC network to the metropolitan area from big centers, and for Radio Access Network,
  > respectively, to allow application developers to to deliver low-latency applications
  > at scale to the end users.
  >
  > As the resources in that locations were designed for specific workloads, and
  > also have limited and more expensive cloud services, cluster operators should be
  > able to create worker nodes on the edge networks on day zero operations.
  >
  > This enhancement introduces a new compute pool named `edge`, which will create
  > MachineSets for each availability zone on the AWS Local Zones.
  >
  > The implementation was divided into three phases:
  >
  > - Phase 0: Research. Understand the Local Zones using the OKD/OCP, create use case and
  >   provides the documentation of installation a cluster in an existing VPC.
  > - Phase 1: Install a cluster in user provided network introducing to the installer a new
  >   compute pool named `edge`. The MachineSet manifests will be created for each subnet
  >   provided on `platform.aws.subnets` for Local Zones. The Machine will be protected with
  >   taints to avoid running the normal platform workloads.
  > - Phase 2: The installer should automate the network resource creation when the user
  >   provides zone names with type `local-zone` on the `platform.aws.zones` or
  >   `compute[?name=="edge"].platform.aws.zones`.
  >
  > Phases 1 and 2 are covered by this enhancement.

- [1233](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1233): (5/5) hypershift: AUTH-311: hypershift: add an enhancement on trust separation (stlaz) ([AUTH-311](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AUTH-311))

  `lgtm`

  > At the time of writing the Hypershift is generating most of its certificates
  > by using a single trust-all root CA. This enhancement describes how and why
  > such a bundle should be split in order to assure workload portability between
  > OpenShift-based products.

- [1234](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1234): (5/5) cloud-integration: New "External" PlatformType addition proposal (lobziik) ([OCPPLAN-9429](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-9429)) ([OCPPLAN-8156](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-8156))

  > Historically, the k8s project contained plenty of code for handling integration with
  > various cloud providers (AWS, GCP, vSphere). These pieces were developed and released along with the k8s as a part of a core,
  > however, over time, the community concluded that this approach does not scale and manages well and should be changed.
  > The community put a lot of energy into introducing the [mechanism](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-cloud-provider/2392-cloud-controller-manager) to allow cloud-providers and community members
  > to build, develop, test and release provider-specific components independently from the Kubernetes core.
  >
  > Speaking about the Openshift integrations with cloud providers - for the moment, a lot of things are tended to be encoded
  > in [the Openshift codebase](https://docs.providers.openshift.org/cloud-controller-manager/#integrating-with-other-openshift-components)
  > within API definitions, operators logic, and installer program code.
  > This fact creates quite  a lot of obstacles for RH partners and community members in their attempts to add new cloud providers to Openshift,
  > as well as making RH engineering involvement quite necessary.
  >
  > Lately, there have been several initiatives around making Openshift more composable and flexible,
  > for example [Capabilites selection](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/installer/component-selection.md) and
  > [Platform Operators](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/olm/platform-operators.md) are
  > the significant steps towards this direction. However, despite having these powerful instruments, there is still necessary
  > to land a code into the Openshift codebase for technical enablement of a new cloud provider, which might be hard or
  > nearly impossible for external contributors.
  >
  > This EP describes adding a new special platform type, referred here as "External".
  >
  > Imagine some "MomAndPop Cloud" have created an infrastructure platform that resembles AWS but has its own API that is different than AWS.
  > They would like to give their users the best OpenShift experience possible, but integrating their code into a Red Hat release is not possible for them.
  > Using the "External" platform, [capabilities](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/installer/component-selection.md),
  > and [platform operators](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/olm/platform-operators.md), they can still deliver this functionality by creating their own Cloud Controller Managers,
  > CSI drivers, network topology operators, Machine API controllers, and OpenShift configurations.
  > This allows "MomAndPop Cloud" to provide the best OpenShift experience while also developing their components
  > without the necessity of tying to Red Hat's internal processes or keeping a fork of the significant part of the Openshift code base.
  >
  > The new "External" platform type would serve as a signal when OpenShift is running on an infrastructure platform
  > that will receive supplemental components from the infrastructure provider.
  >
  > "External" is different from our current platform types in that it will signal that the infrastructure
  > is specifically not "None" or any of the known providers (e.g., AWS, GCP, etc.).
