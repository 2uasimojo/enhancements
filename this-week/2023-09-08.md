- [1307](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1307): (5/330) ingress: CFE-815: Route secret injection for external certificate management (thejasn) ([CM-815](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CM-815))

  > Currently, users of OpenShift cannot very easily integrate OpenShift Routes
  > with third-party certificate management solutions like [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager).
  > And this is mainly due to the design of Routes API which deliberately requires the certificate
  > data to be present in the Route object as opposed to having a reference. This is especially
  > problematic when third-party solutions also manage the life cycle (create/renew/delete)
  > of the generated certificates which OpenShift Routes does not support and requires
  > manual intervention to manage certificate life cycle.
  >
  > This enhancement aims to provide a solution where OpenShift Routes can support
  > integration with third-party certificate management solutions like cert-manager and
  > avoid manual certificate management by the user which is more error prone.

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > CSI driver operators are OCP specific operators that install and manage CSI drivers shipped by OCP either as part of
  > payload or as optional operators installed by OLM.
  >
  > In this document we propose that all these operators are compiled from a single git repository, as they're mostly
  > copy-paste.
