## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized Active pull request:

- [1067](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1067): (76/311) agent-installer: Automated Workflow for Agent-based Installer (dhellmann) ([AGENT-10](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AGENT-10))

  `tide/merge-method-squash, priority/important-soon`

  > "Cluster 0" deployments, for the first cluster in an environment, are
  > unique because they occur in situations where there may not be a lot
  > of other infrastructure to support long-running services normally
  > associated with automated provisioning for on-premises use
  > cases. Nevertheless, users and partners want to automate these
  > deployments. The assisted installer GUI provides an excellent user
  > experience for deploying connected clusters. This enhancement covers
  > the *automation* use case for disconnected clusters.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 9 Other Merged pull requests:

- [461](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/461): (4/34) ingress: NE-406: ingress: Add aws-elb-idle-timeout enhancement (Miciah) ([NE-357](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-357))

  > This enhancement extends the IngressController API to allow the user to
  > configure the timeout period for idle connections to an IngressController that
  > is published using an AWS Classic Elastic Load Balancer.

- [1048](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1048): (9/120) network: Dual Stack VIPs for on-prem deployments (cybertron)

  > Originally the on-prem loadbalancer architecture supported only single-stack
  > ipv4 or ipv6 deployments. When dual stack support was added for the baremetal
  > platform, we carried over the VIP configuration that only allowed for a single
  > VIP to be specified. The thinking was that in dual stack clusters every node
  > would have access to either ipv4 or ipv6 endpoints. While this is true of the
  > nodes, it is not necessarily true of the applications that run in or out of
  > the cluster and may need to interact with the API or ingress services.
  >
  > This design is proposing the addition of a second pair of VIPs for dual stack
  > clusters so API and ingress are accessible from either ip version.

- [1075](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1075): (5/87) machine-api: [OCPCLOUD-1436] AWS IMDSv2 support in MAPI and Installer config (lobziik)

  > For increasing security and add protection against open firewalls, reverse proxies, and SSRF vulnerabilities Amazon introduced
  > [enhancements to the EC2 Instance Metadata Service](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/defense-in-depth-open-firewalls-reverse-proxies-ssrf-vulnerabilities-ec2-instance-metadata-service/)
  > (IMDSv2). It is a session-based interaction method with Instance Metadata Service (IMDS), in other words,
  > all requests to `http://169.254.169.254` will require prior PUT requests for obtaining token and such token must be used in further requests.
  > This document describes and proposes several interfaces for configuring IMDS behaviour for newly created machines via Machine API and
  > during the installation procedure.

- [1087](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1087): (35/35) single-node: tools: add metadata linting step to linter job (dhellmann) ([MGMT-8414](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-8414))

  > This enhancement aims to enable adding workers to a single control-plane node
  > cluster by attempting to tackle multiple issues that arise when worker nodes
  > are added to such clusters.
