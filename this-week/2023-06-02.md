### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 7 New pull requests:

- [1409](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1409): (2/2) network: [DNM] Upgrades with OVN IC (ricky-rav) ([SDN-3905](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-3905))

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > Allow a 4.13 cluster to smoothly upgrade to 4.14, which features OVN IC multizone.
  > Allow a 4.14 multizone cluster to roll back to 4.14 1-zone if needed and also to switch back to multizone.

- [1410](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1410): (32/32) cluster-logging: LOG-1344: Multi clusterlogforwarder proposal (jcantrill)

  `do-not-merge/hold, jira/valid-reference`

  > Log forwarding is functionally a "cluster singleton" where the operator explicitly only reconcilies a **ClusterLogForwarder** in the  namespace *openshift-logging* named *instance*.  This enhancement removes that restriction to allow administrators to define multiple instance of **ClusterLogForwarder** while retaining the legacy behavior.

- [1412](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1412): (20/20) general: auth: add enhancement for unsupported direct kube-apiserver oidc config (stlaz)

  > This PR adds an enhancement that debates configuring an OIDC provider directly with the kube-apiserver with unsupportedConfigOverrides.
  >
  > It adds a study where Keycloak was configured this way and how it influenced some basic components function.
  >
  > /cc @deads2k
  > /assign @openshift/openshift-team-auth

- [1413](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1413): (8/8) single-node: Relocatable single node openshift (eranco74) ([MGMT-14516](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-14516)) ([OCPBU-608](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBU-608))

  > This enhancement proposes the ability to relocate a single node OpenShift (SNO). This capability is critical for fast deployment at the edge and for validating a complete solution before shipping to the edge.
  >
  > Upon deployment at the edge site, the SNO should allow reconfiguring specific cluster attributes for OCP to function correctly at the edge site.
  >
  > ____________

- [1414](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1414): (2/2) network: Admin Network Policy in OVN-K (tssurya) ([SDN-2931](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-2931)) ([SDN-2932](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-2932))

  > This enhancement outlines the design details to implement `Admin Network Policy` and
  > `Baseline Admin Network Policy` APIs in OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin. These are
  > [new APIs that are currently in v1alpha1 version](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/network-policy-api/tree/master/apis/v1alpha1)
  > and maintained by upstream Kubernetes `sig-network-policy-api` working group.

- [1415](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1415): (26/26) ingress: Make ingress operator optional (alebedev87) ([NE-1129](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-1129))

  > This enhancement describes the implementation of a new capability to enable/disable the default ingress of the OpenShift cluster.
  > The new capability (from here on called the ingress capability) includes [the cluster ingress operator](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-ingress-operator) as well as the custom resources managed by the operator.
  > This enhancement focuses on the requirements for [RFE-3395](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RFE-3395) which targets ROSA, a managed OpenShift service based on HyperShift. The implementation of the ingress capability on the standalone OpenShift is out of the scope of this enhancement.
