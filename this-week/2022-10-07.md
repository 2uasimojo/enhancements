- [918](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/918): (5/269) installer: vsphere: add multiple datacenter and clusters (jcpowermac) ([SPLAT-320](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SPLAT-320))

  > The goal of this enhancement is to provide the ability to install in a
  > vSphere environment with multiple datacenters and clusters.
  >
  > This will be an opinionated design, the vCenter datacenter will always be a `region`
  > and a vCenter cluster will always be a `zone`.

- [1237](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1237): (25/144) microshift: Add MicroShift Default CSI Plugin proposal (copejon) ([USHIFT-41](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/USHIFT/issues/USHIFT-41))

  > This enhancement proposes the adoption of a
  > default [Container Storage Interface(CSI) Plugin](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/)for Microshift. For more
  > details on MicroShift, see the respective [proposal](./kubernetes-for-device-edge.md). Kubernetes' CSI implementation
  > provides a standardized model for exposing block and file storage systems to container workloads.

There were 4 Other Merged pull requests:

- [1134](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1134): (27/120) installer: adding gcp-ipi-shared-vpc (jstuever) ([CORS-1774](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CORS-1774))

  > This enhancement adds the capability to deploy a GCP cluster into a [Shared VPC
  > (XPN)](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc) configuration using the
  > Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI) workflow.

- [1177](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1177): (45/135) ingress: NE-954: LoadBalancer Allowed Source Ranges Enhancement Proposal (suleymanakbas91) ([NE-555](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-555))

  > This enhancement extends the IngressController API to allow the user to specify a
  > list of IP address ranges for an IngressController to which access to the LoadBalancer Service
  > should be restricted when `endpointPublishingStrategy` is `LoadBalancerService`.
  > By default, all source addresses are allowed (which is equivalent to
  > specifying "0.0.0.0/0" for IPv4 and "::/0" for IPv6). Currently, the only way for the customers to limit
  > this is by setting the `.Spec.LoadBalancerSourceRanges` field or
  > `service.beta.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-source-ranges` annotation for the LoadBalancer Service
  > in front of the router in cloud environments. This is not desired as we prefer
  > the customers to use the APIs and to not directly modify the managed resources.

- [1240](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1240): (12/30) storage: STOR-828: CSI Inline Ephemeral Volume Security (dobsonj) ([STOR-746](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/STOR-746))

  > Provide a mechanism where the use of an individual CSI driver capable of
  > provisioning CSI ephemeral volumes (also known as inline ephemeral volumes or
  > inline CSI volumes) can be restricted on pod admission.
