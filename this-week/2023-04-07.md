There were 3 Merged pull requests:

- [1338](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1338): (2/182) network: [SDN-2481] Enhancement proposal to migrate Multiple External Gateways to use a CRD (jordigilh) ([SDN-2481](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-2481))

  > When it comes to ingress traffic, load balancers and reverse proxies take care of redirecting traffic to one of potentially multiple destinations. Egress traffic is no different. Although it is already possible to use egress gateways, telco customers require the capability to use a common and secure API to dynamically configure one or more egress next hops per namespace.
  >
  > Multiple External Gateway is an existing OVN-K feature that uses external gateways for ingress and egress traffic for all the pods in an annotated namespace, using the following pod and namespace. More information can be found in this [white paper](https://www.f5.com/pdf/white-papers/f5-telco-gateway-for-red-hat-openshift-wp.pdf).
  > The list of annotations used in the current implementation are as follow:
  >
  > * Namespace
  >   * `k8s.ovn.org/routing-external-gws`
  >   * `k8s.ovn.org/bfd-enabled`
  > * Pod
  >   * `k8s.ovn.org/routing-namespaces`
  >   * `k8s.ovn.org/routing-network`
  >   * `k8s.ovn.org/bfd-enabled`
  >
  > However, to ensure only trusted namespaces and deployments use these annotations, it is necessary to leverage on an additional service that controls their usage, such as an admission webhook that can filter which pods use these annotations and in which namespaces.
