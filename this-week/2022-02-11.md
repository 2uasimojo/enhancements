  > Enable OCP users to leverage [Azure Ultra Disks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#ultra-disks) on Machine API provisioned hosts on Azure via Data Disks or to attach them to Machines via Persistent Volumes (PVs).


### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 5 New pull requests:

- [1027](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1027): (2/2) general: Enable ProjectRequestLimit on OpenShift 4.x (josefkarasek)

  > The `requestlimit.project.openshift.io/ProjectRequestLimit` admission plugin is used to impose a limit on the number of
  > self-provisioned project(s) requested by a given user/service account. In 3.x, the limit can be specified via the master configuration file.
  > It doesn't fit well with our targeted configuration which aims to avoid adding lots of intricately documented knobs.
  > This is why this admission plug-in is disabled in OpenShift 4.x.
  >
  > Instead of wiring the admission plugin via the `openshift-apiserver` operator, we can create a validating admission webhook
  > based on the [generic-admission-server](https://github.com/openshift/generic-admission-server) and distribute it via
  > OperatorHub/OLM.

- [1028](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1028): (11/11) cluster-logging: flow-control-api spec (pmoogi-redhat)

  > If the log collector cannot keep up with the rate that logs are written, some logging data will be lost.
  > Lack of  flow control these problems:
  > * Hard to predict and impossible to control the volume of logs.
  > * No control over which logs get lost.
  > * During an outage, log buffers build up without user control.
  >   This can cause long recovery times and very high latency when the connection is restored.
  >
  > This proposal defines an API to let cluster administrators to limit logging rates, or ignore some logs entirely.
  > Logs may still be lost if the collector cannot keep up, but administrators have more control over *what* is lost,
  > and more predictability of log rates.

- [1029](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1029): (187/187) network: OVN-Kubernetes on Hypershift (squeed)

  > [Hypershift](https://hypershift-docs.netlify.app/) is a new deployment model for OpenShift which removes the requirement that clusters be "self-hosted". Rather, a given hosted cluster's control plane actually resides as pods on another "management" cluster.
  >
  > Adapting the OVN networking plugin to the Hypershift model requires some careful design. Specifically, OVN provides its own control plane and datastore, all of which will be hosted external to the hosted cluster.
  >
  > Thus, the OpenShift OVN deployment model must be updated to support split control planes. Likewise, the Network Operator must be able to manage components on both the control plane as well as the hosted cluster.

- [1030](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1030): (10/10) monitoring: enhancements/monitoring: User-Defined Alerting and Relabeling Rules (bison)

  > The core OpenShift components ship a large number of Prometheus alerting rules.
  > A 4.10-nightly cluster on AWS currently has 175 alerts defined by default, and
  > enabling additional add-ons increases that number.  Still, users have repeatedly
  > asked for a supported method of adding additional custom rules, adjusting
  > thresholds, or adding and modifying labels on existing platform alerting rules
  > -- for example, changing severity labels.
  >
  > These modifications are currently not possible, because the alerts are managed
  > by operators and cannot be modified, and the addition of custom rules is
  > explicitly unsupported at the moment.  This proposal outlines a solution for
  > allowing additional user-defined rules and relabeling operations on existing
  > platform alerting rules.

- [1032](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1032): (2/2) general: OpenShift CoreOS Layering (provisional) (cgwalters)

  > Change RHEL CoreOS as shipped in OpenShift to be a "base image" that can be used as in layered container builds and then booted.  This will allow custom 3rd party agents delivered via RPMs installed in a container build.  The MCO will roll out and monitor these custom builds the same way it does for the "pristine" CoreOS image today.
  >
  > This is the OpenShift integration of [ostree native containers](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainer) or [CoreOS layering](https://github.com/coreos/enhancements/pull/7) via the MCO.
