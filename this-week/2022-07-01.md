### Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Merged pull requests:

- [1114](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1114): (18/170) ingress: [NE-568] Add option to manage DNS to ingresscontrollers (thejasn) ([CFEPLAN-58](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CFEPLAN-58))

  > The ingress operator currently assumes that it's going to create and
  > manage DNS using the required cloud provider integration. But in some
  > circumstances, the required DNS zone may be different from the cluster
  > DNS zone and may not even be hosted in the cloud provider. In such scenarios,
  > the operator reports a degraded state after attempting to provision the required
  > resources in the cloud provider because the provided DNS can't be created.
  >
  > This enhancement aims to provide the end-user the ability to completely disable
  > DNS management on an Ingress Controller.

- [1153](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1153): (3/24) update: Enhancement to refine ClusterVersion history pruning (jottofar) ([OTA-664](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OTA-664))

  > CVO currently maintains a 50 entry queue of installed versions.
  > Once the queue is full CVO simply removes the first added entry.
  > The intent of the pruner as modified by this [commit][commit] was to remove the first added partial update entry, if one exists, otherwise to simply remove the first entry.
  > Even once [rhbz#2097067][rhbz-2097067] is fixed this can result in the removal of useful cluster version information such as the initial installed version.
  > Because some things such as install-time infrastructure depend on the initial version, we want to preserve that entry.
  > There are additional history entries which should be given preference when determining which entry to remove.
  > This enhancement defines a more intelligent history pruning algorithm with the goal of keeping the more informative history entries, as defined below.
  > In addition, the history queue will be expanded to 100 entries.

- [1163](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1163): (20/20) installer: Installer: user-encrypted storage keys enhancement (patrickdillon)

  > When user-managed encryption keys are provided at install time, the default storage
  > class should be set to utilize those keys. Presently, only root volumes for nodes are
  > encrypted with those keys--but users would expect the persistent storage volumes to
  > be encrypted as well. This enhancement proposes a solution for AWS, GCP, & Azure.
