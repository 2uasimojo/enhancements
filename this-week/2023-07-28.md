- [1296](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1296): (111/1284) ingress: Enhancement Proposal for Adding HTTP header to HAProxy Without Customizing haproxy.config Template (miheer) ([NE-982](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-982)) ([RFE-464](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RFE-464))

  > This enhancement extends the IngressController API and Route API to allow the user to set or delete
  > specific HTTP request and response headers (barring certain headers that it may be dangerous to allow customizing).

- [1391](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1391): (14/110) authentication: AUTH-372: enhancements/authentication: Custom SCC preemption prevention (s-urbaniak) ([AUTH-132](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AUTH-132))

  > OpenShift ships SCCs by default that applies both to core OpenShift workloads
  > as well as to user provided workloads.
  >
  > Users have the possibility to add custom SCCs to OpenShift.
  > These can impact core OpenShift workloads and, worst case, break out of the box components.
  >
  > This enhancement proposal suggests a mechanism to be able to protect core OpenShift
  > out of the box workloads from side effects induced by custom SCCs.

- [1423](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1423): (11/20) storage: STOR-1310: Enhancement for Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator (dobsonj) ([STOR-676](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/STOR-676))

  > The [Secrets Store CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/secrets-store-csi-driver)
  > allows users to mount secrets from an external secret store (like Azure Key Vault for
  > example) as an ephemeral volume on a pod. This is done via a CSI driver that supports
  > ephemeral volumes, along with a provider plugin that communicates with the external
  > secret provider. This document describes how this driver can be deployed by an
  > optional operator on OpenShift.

### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 6 New pull requests:

- [1442](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1442): (4/4) cluster-logging: Cluster Logging Proposal: output record format options. (alanconway) ([LOG-2827](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2827))

  > The logging operator produces records using the "ViaQ" data model and labelling scheme.
  > Users requesting more flexibility in the output format:
  >
  > - Reduced log size by excluding some metadata fields.
  > - Alternate data models, for example OpenTelemetry.
  > - Alternate encodings, for example forwarding original log text without additional meta-data.
  >   In future other encodings might be requested, for example GRPC protobuf.
  >
  > This enhancement proposes API extensions to configure these options.

- [1445](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1445): (32/32) microshift: USHIFT-1473: feat: retro ep for storage migration (eggfoobar) ([USHIFT-1473](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-1473))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > We have embedded the
  > [Migrator](https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes-kube-storage-version-migrator/tree/master/cmd/migrator)
  > and
  > [Trigger](https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes-kube-storage-version-migrator/tree/master/cmd/trigger)
  > controllers in MicroShift to assure successive upgrades to MicroShift do not
  > cause a situation where an API no longer exists for resource versions stored in
  > ETCD.

- [1446](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1446): (90/90) ingress: This a followup commit for PR https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1296 (miheer) ([NE-982](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-982)) ([RFE-464](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RFE-464))

  > specific HTTP request and response headers (barring certain headers that it may be dangerous to allow customizing).

- [1447](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1447): (3/3) etcd: ETCD-425: adding etcd tuning profiles enhancement (dusk125) ([ETCD-425](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ETCD-425))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > This enhancement would replace the hardcoded values for the etcd parameters HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL and LEADER_ELECTION_TIMEOUT with predefined "profiles".
  > Each profile would map to predefined, and pretested, values for the internal etcd parameters.
  > This would allow for some user tweaking without giving them access to the full range of values.
  > This enhancement only covers the mvp for a tech preview release of this new feature; a future enhancement will be necessary.
