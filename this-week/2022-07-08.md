### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 6 New pull requests:

- [1167](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1167): (20/20) installer: openstack: add the notion of Failure Domains in the installer (EmilienM) ([OSASINFRA-2908](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSASINFRA-2908))

  > For organizations where service availability is a concern, networking architectures are usually more modern than what we can find in a traditional datacenter.
  > For example, the "Spine and Leaf" design is a recommended choice when deploying OpenStack at scale.
  > In this architecture, each leaf (lower-level access switch) is connected to multiple spines (upper-level core switch) in a full mesh. The latency becomes predictable, there is no more bottleneck and overall the resilience is improved.
  > Each leaf brings their own network fabrics that are usually using their own power units. Also each network fabric manages their its own Layer-2 domain, and therefore network subnets. Routing protocols are usually used so applications can communicate each other in the datacenter, since they don't live within the same domain anymore.
  >
  > In this enhancement, we would like to support the deployment of OpenShift into multiple subnets from day 1, using IPI.
  > To accomplish this, the OpenStack administrator will pre-create a Routed Provider Network and one or multiple subnets per leaf, which will be linked to an Availability Zone, here called Failure Domain for a better understanding.
  > Each Failure Domain will have its own network subnet and storage resources used by OpenShift.
  > This feature will remove the limitation that we have today in BYON (Bring your own network) which is the support of a single primary subnet for the machines on day 1. We want to be able to deploy the cluster across multiple subnets and storage sources, where each resource live in a given Failure Domain.

- [1170](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1170): (173/173) olm: Add a platform operators (phase 0) proposal (timflannagan) ([OLM-2232](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLM-2232)) ([OLM-2513](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLM-2513)) ([OLM-2605](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLM-2605))

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > The enhancement outlines a mechanism that enables support for the lifecycle of platform operators. A platform operator (PO) is an OLM-based cluster extension that can be installed during day 0 operations, and lifecycles with the cluster. This mechanism will ultimately be divided into phases, and this proposal covers the first phase in more detail.
  >
  > This first phase introduces a basic PO installation mechanism, and helps build the foundational layer for subsequent phases. Future phases may introduce a first-class PO management mechanism for the OLM component.

- [1175](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1175): (3/3) windows-containers: [WINC] WMCO: Update container runtime details (mansikulkarni96)

  > The intent of this enhancement is to allow a cluster administrator to add a
  > Windows compute node as a day 2 operation with a prescribed configuration to an
  > installer provisioned OpenShift 4.6 cluster and enable scheduling of Windows
  > workloads. The targeted platforms for 4.6 are vSphere, Azure and AWS. The
  > cluster has to be configured with Hybrid OVN networking.

- [1176](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1176): (2/2) installer: enhancements/installer/component-selection: Fix "capabilities" -> "capability's" typo (wking) ([OCPPLAN-7589](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-7589))

  > This enhancement proposes a mechanism for cluster installers to exclude one or more optional components
  > (capabilities) for their installation which will determine which payload components are/are not installed
  > in their cluster.  Core components are defined as the set of Second Level Operators managed by the Cluster
  > Version Operator which today cannot be disabled until after completing the install and editing a CVO
  > override, or editing the CVO overrides as part of rendering+editing manifests.  In addition, using CVO
  > overrides put the cluster into an unsupported and un-upgradeable state, making it insufficient as a solution.
  >
  > The proposed UX is to make this a first class part of the install config api with the implementation
  > being arguments supplied to the CVO to filter out the user-selected manifests based on groupings called
  > capabilities.

- [1177](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1177): (2/2) ingress: NE-954: LoadBalancer Allowed Source Ranges Enhancement Proposal (suleymanakbas91) ([NE-555](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-555))

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > This enhancement extends the IngressController API to allow the user to specify a
  > list of IP address ranges for an IngressController to which access to the LoadBalancer Service
  > should be restricted when `endpointPublishingStrategy` is `LoadBalancerService`.
  > By default, all source addresses are allowed (which is equivalent to
  > specifying "0.0.0.0/0"). Currently, the only way for the customers to limit this is by
  > setting `.Spec.LoadBalancerSourceRanges` field for the LoadBalancer Service
  > in front of the router in cloud environments. This is not desired as we prefer
  > the customers use the APIs and do not directly modify the managed resources.
