There were 8 Other Merged pull requests:

- [1244](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1244): (5/38) hypershift: CNF-6291: Enable Performance tuning for Hypershift nodes (jlojosnegros) ([PSAP-742](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PSAP-742))

  > This enhancement describes how the [Performance Profile Controller](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-node-tuning-operator/blob/master/docs/performanceprofile/performance_controller.md), previously known as Performance add-on operator,
  > will run in Hypershift's managed control plane.
  >
  > This is part of Phase-3 for Node Tunning Operator enablement and so it depends on the two previous phases.

- [1260](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1260): (10/106) installer: installer-aws: Cluster deployment on AWS Outpost (pkliczewski) ([OCPPLAN-9617](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-9617)) ([ECOPROJECT-866](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ECOPROJECT-866))

  > Running workload closer to end users or leveraging data locality seems to be
  > important for many customers. That is why AWS came up with fully [managed
  > service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/how-outposts-works.html)
  > that extends AWS infrastructure and run on customer's premises. This enhancement
  > proposes extending how we deploy OCP on AWS platform so it is possible to run on
  > AWS Outpost.
  >
  > The work is divided into several phases:
  > - Phase 0: Research. Understand what is needed to deploy OCP on AWS Outpost.
  >   No code changes needed and we only provide [documentation](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/pull/53265) on how to customize
  >   generated manifests and list known limitations.
  > - Phase 1: Improve cluster deployment on AWS Outposts by implementing necessary
  >   changes and provide mitigations to know limitations.
  > - Phase 2: Add OCP on AWS Outpost support to ROSA for regular clusters and HyperShift.

- [1322](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1322): (24/184) network: [OCPBU-156] enhancement proposal for external loadbalancer (EmilienM) ([OCPBU-156](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBU-156)) ([OSASINFRA-3069](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSASINFRA-3069))

  > Originally the on-premise IPI architecture was designed to deploy an internal
  > loadbalancer based on HAproxy, Keepalived.
  > When customers needed more flexibility for the control-plane VIPs management, they would
  > deploy with the UPI method.
  >
  > Also, customers have the possibility to use another loadbalancer ([example with OpenStack](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/networking/load-balancing-openstack.html#nw-osp-configuring-external-load-balancer_load-balancing-openstack))
  > for the control-plane VIPs but OpenShift would still deploy Keepalived and HAproxy in the
  > control-plane. This can be problematic in some scenarios (if VIPs are not in the same subnet).
  >
  > This design is proposing the support for using an external loadbalancer
  > for the API and Ingress VIPs, so this can be managed outside of the cluster,
  > by the customer.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 7 Other New pull requests:

- [1335](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1335): (52/52) dns:  CFE-748: Improve CoreDNS Integration with EgressFirewall (arkadeepsen) ([CFE-748](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CFE-748))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > This enhancement improves the integration of CoreDNS with EgressFirewall. With this improved
  > integration, EgressFirewall will be able to better support DNS names whose IPs change dynamically
  > and also will be able to provide support for wildcard DNS names.

- [1338](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1338): (85/85) network: [SDN-2481] Enhancement proposal to migrate Multiple External Gateways to use a CRD (jordigilh) ([SDN-2481](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-2481))

  > When it comes to ingress traffic, load balancers and reverse proxies take care of redirecting traffic to one of potentially multiple destinations. Egress traffic is no different. Although it is already possible to use egress gateways, telco customers require the ability to dynamically configure one or more egress next hops per namespace via a common and secure API.
  >
  > OVN already supports the ability to configure multiple external gateways via pod and namespace annotations:
  >
  > * `k8s.ovn.org/routing-external-gws`
  > * `k8s.ovn.org/external-gw-pod-ips`
  > * `k8s.ovn.org/routing-namespaces`
  > * `k8s.ovn.org/routing-network`
  > * `k8s.ovn.org/bfd-enabled`
  >
  > However, to ensure only trusted deployments use these annotations the solution is to leverage on an admission webhook that filter which pods can use these annotations and in which namespaces.

- [1339](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1339): (30/30) cloud-integration: STS enablement (bentito)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > Amazon Web Services (AWS) Secure Token Service (STS) allows you to request temporary limited-privilege credentials. A concrete
  > example is write permission on an S3 bucket on AWS. STS is supported on all the major cloud providers where OpenShift is
  > deployed. Currently, several Red Hat operators provide detailed instructions for how to use the operator on STS-enabled
  > clusters. The process is designed to have manual operations performed by the customer. This enhancement seeks to bring common standards to the process of enabling an
  > operator to access cloud provider resources, by enabling automation, UX and logic for the process.

- [1340](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1340): (13/13) network: Node IP selection for UPI platforms (pliurh) ([NP-687](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NP-687))

  > When Openshift is deployed on user-provisioned infrastructure, and there are
  > more than one NIC available on the hosts. We need a reliable way to guarantee
  > all the openshift components can use the correct IP/interface.

- [1342](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1342): (14/14) network: networking: Live migration for ovn-k + hypershift + kubevirt (qinqon)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > The [Hypershift](https://hypershift-docs.netlify.app/) project creates openshift clusters on demand on top of already provisioned openshift, those clusters are called "hosted", "nested" or "guest" clusters. Hypershift has different providers to spin up the worker noded of "hosted" cluster, so users can create the workers as VMs on Azure, Amazon, GCP, etc… one of such providers is the
  > kubevirt and it spins up the workers as kubevirt virtual machines.
  >
  > There are some network requirements, some of them are imposed by kubevirt
  > live migration and others by kubernetes:
  >
  > - Consistent IP follows VM during Live Migration, and is the IP of the primary guest node interface that the kubelet uses to register/communicate with.
  > - Guest Cluster Network isolation. Guest clusters shouldn’t be able to talk to other guest clusters directly except through public LBs. Guest clusters shouldn’t be able to talk to any infra components except through public LBs
  > - No TCP connection breakage over E/W and N/S during live migration with minimal disruption.
  >
  > To accomplish that the ovn-kubernetes default network handling has to implement some features triggered when a
  > hypershift kubevirt VM is detected.

- [1344](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1344): (2/2) guidelines: Add guidelines for naming CI jobs (stbenjam)

  > This adds guidelines for naming CI jobs based on how existing jobs are named. It's not intended to force anyone to rename older jobs (job renames have historically been quite disruptive to things like historical data collection), but rather provide guidance in how teams should name new CI jobs.
  >
  > Not sure if this should live in enhancements or the ci-docs repo.
