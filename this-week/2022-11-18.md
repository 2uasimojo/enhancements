There were 3 Merged pull requests:

- [1189](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1189): (7/103) installer: Installer: check operators for stability (patrickdillon)

  > This enhancement proposes that the OpenShift Installer should check the status
  > of individual cluster operators and use those statuses as a threshold for
  > determining whether an install is a success (exit 0) or failure (exit != 0).
  > Specifically, the Installer should check whether cluster operators have stopped
  > progressing for a certain amount of time. If the Installer sees that an operator
  > is Available=true but fails to enter a stable Progressing=false state, the Installer
  > will exit non-zero and log an error.

### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 New pull requests:

- [1284](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1284): (16/16) hypershift: propose pluggable konnectivity (2uasimojo) ([OCPPLAN-5771](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-5771))

  > For worker-less deployments, hypershift deploys a konnectivity-server and -agent to facilitate seamless communication *from* the hosted control plane *to* the services running on its behalf in the hosting cluster.
  > At the time of this writing, the list of services thus supported is static and hardcoded.
  >
  > This enhancement proposes a mechanism to facilitate adding any service to konnectivity.

- [1285](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1285): (11/11) console: Enhancement doc to customize default pre-pinned resources on navigation (debsmita1) ([ODC-5012](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ODC-5012))

  > The Developer perspective on the OpenShift Console provides pinned resources on the navigation which enables the user to go to the resourceâ€™s list page with a single click.
  >
  > Some customers want to provide defaults for those pre-pinned resources for all users.
  >
  > On the Developer perspective navigation, users can see the default pinned resources if they have not customized these pinned resources. The customers have no way to set these default pinned resources for their users.
  >
  > This enhancement allows cluster admins to define pre-pinned resources for new users and users who have not customized their navigation items.
  >

- [1287](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1287): (9/9) dev-guide: dev-guide/api-conventions: Explain preference for single canonical phrasing (wking)

  > Proximal trigger is @deads2k's concern about ClusterVersion's `spec.desiredUpdate` being a pointer structure (violating our current API conventions) where both the nil:
  >
  > ```yaml
  > spec: {}
  > ```
  >
  > and the empty-struct:
  >
  > ```yaml
  > spec:
  >   desiredUpdate: {}
  > ```
  >
  > have the same semantics.  If we created desiredUpdate today, the OpenShift anti-pointer preference would have forbidden the nil case, but this section gives more motivational background for folks creating new APIs.
