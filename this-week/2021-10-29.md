There were 11 Other Merged pull requests:

- [571](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/571): (3/277) network: Cloud API component for egress IP (alexanderConstantinescu)

  > OVN-Kubernetes and openshift-sdn today support the feature egress IP on
  > bare-metal platforms. Going forward both network plugins will need to support
  > the feature on conventional cloud provider platforms (such as: GCP, AWS, Azure).
  > Cloud providers require additional management of the egress IP address via the
  > cloud provider's cloud API. That is required since the cloud provider will not
  > let the network plugin claim an additional IP on the node, which it does not
  > recognize.
  >
  > To be able to do this we will need to add logic to a dedicated component as to
  > be able to handle this. This enhancement proposal goes into detail concerning:
  >
  > - The cloud provider data model required as to manage egress IP assignments in
  >   the cloud
  > - The model and interaction between this future entity, the network plugin and
  >   any additional component required for this interaction to happen.
  >
  > OpenShift 4.10 aims to finalize this component for cloud egress IP assignments,
  > functional with both openshift-sdn and OVN-Kubernetes, supporting: Azure, GCP
  > and AWS. This document tries however to make an abstraction from the
  > requirements and deadlines set for each cloud w.r.t. each OpenShift release.
  > Hence it does not solely focus on AWS or Azure, but instead aims at defining an
  > architecture which is cloud agnostic and which would be applied with minimal
  > implementation efforts for additional clouds.

- [673](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/673): (9/88) machine-api: short-circuiting-backoff (mshitrit)

  > By using `MachineHealthChecks` a cluster admin can configure automatic remediation of unhealthy machines and nodes.
  > The machine healthcheck controller's remediation strategy is deleting the machine, and letting the cloud provider
  > create a new one. This isn't the best remediation strategy in all environments.
  >
  > Any Machine that enters the `Failed` state is remediated immediately, without waiting, by the MHC.
  > When this occurs, if the error which caused the failure is persistent (spot price too low, configuration error), replacement Machines will also be `Failed`.
  > As replacement machines start and fail, MHC causes a hot loop of Machine being deleted and recreated.
  > This hot looping makes it difficult for users to find out why their Machines are failing.
  > Another side effect of machines constantly failing, is the risk of hitting the benchmark of machine failures percentage - thus triggering the "short-circuit" mechanism which will prevent all remediations.
  >
  > With this enhancement we propose a better mechanism.
  > In case a machine enters the `Failed` state and does not have a NodeRef or a ProviderID, it will not be remediated until after a certain time period has passed - thus allowing a manual intervention in order to break to hot loop.

- [687](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/687): (3/125) storage: Add AWS EFS CSI driver operator (jsafrane)

  > AWS EFS CSI driver (+ corresponding operator) is an optional OCP component. It should be installed through OLM, when
  > users opts-in.
  >
  > This document describes existing (unsupported) solution and how to turn it into a supported one, both from code (and
  > build and shipment), and from user perspective.

- [817](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/817): (77/308) network: Baremetal IPI Network Configuration for Day-1 (cybertron)

  > Currently in the IPI flow, there is no way to provide day-1 network configuration
  > which is a common requirement, particularly for baremetal users.  We can build
  > on the [UPI static networking enhancements](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/rhcos/static-networking-enhancements.md)
  > to enable such configuration in the IPI flow.

- [850](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/850): (8/94) network: Enable flows collection (mariomac)

  > This document describes configuration changes and requirements at the CNO/OVN level
  > to enable network observability as depicted in the high level
  > [Enhancement proposal for Network Observability](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/921).
  >
  > It can be seen as a follow-up of a previous enhancement
  > [bringing Network Flows export support](./netflow.md) to OpenShift when used with
  > OVNKubernetes. In this follow-up, advanced configuration for OvS flows export should
  > be made possible, and a mechanism must be set up to allow interactions between the
  > Cluster Network Operator (CNO) and the Network Observability Operator (NOO - development
  > in progress).

- [866](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/866): (2/264) general: Proposed OLM-based Monitoring Stack Solution for RH Managed Services and future needs. (bwplotka)

  > This document proposes a solution and a delivery plan for scraping, querying and alerting on metrics related to Red Hat Managed Services running in OSD clusters. The proposed solution is not intended to complement the existing monitoring stack managed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator, nor used directly by Customers at this moment.

- [909](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/909): (12/96) baremetal: Include CoreOS ISO in the release payload (zaneb)

  > The baremetal platform is switching from the OpenStack QCOW2 CoreOS image to
  > the live ISO (as also used for UPI). To ensure that existing disconnected
  > clusters can update to this, the ISO image will be included in the release
  > payload. This will be balanced out by removing the RHEL image currently shipped
  > in the release payload.

- [938](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/938): (4/4) monitoring: Add monitoring owners (simonpasquier)

  > @bparees @dhellmann I think that it makes sense for the monitoring team leads and architects to be approvers of the monitoring enhancements. What do you think?

There were 5 Other New pull requests:

- [937](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/937): (71/71) monitoring: support configuration of alerting notifications by application owners (simonpasquier)

  `approved`

  > This document describes a solution that allows OpenShift users to route alert
  > notifications without cluster admin intervention. It complements the existing
  > [user-workload monitoring stack][uwm-docs], enabling a full self-service experience for
  > workload monitoring.

- [939](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/939): (94/94) machine-config: [OCPNODE-725] Control Group v2 Enablement on New Clusters (rphillips)

  > Control Group v2 (cgroup v2) enablement in Kubernetes has progressed to beta
  > [upstream](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2254-cgroup-v2).
  > The underlying runtime (cri-o) and supporting subsystems are now ready for
  > customers to begin their own testing with it. Not all workloads will be
  > compatible with cgroup v2, so it will *not* be enabled by default within
  > OpenShift at this time.
  >
  > Note: This enhancement is focusing on `pure` mode cgroup v2. Mixed mode environments
  > may behave differently (metrics, vpa, hpa, etc) since cgroup v1 is not
  > compatible with cgroup v2.

  > This enhancement adds observability capabilities to Loki operator in the form of Prometheus rules and alerts.
  > These rules and alerts are used to identify abnormal conditions and update operators.
