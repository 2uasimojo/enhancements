## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized Merged pull request:

- [1053](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1053): (42/104) agent-installer: Add agent-based installer concept (zaneb)

  > The agent-based installer is an installation method for on-premises clusters,
  > that will use a bootable, ephemeral installer image running on the hosts that
  > are to become part of the cluster. The user will generate the image using a
  > command-line tool. The image itself will contain components (such as
  > [assisted-service](https://github.com/openshift/assisted-service/#readme) and
  > [assisted-agent](https://github.com/openshift/assisted-installer-agent#readme))
  > of the Assisted and Multi-Cluster Engine (MCE) installation methods. The
  > installer will be usable in both a fully-automated workflow, where
  > configuration is provided upfront, and an interactive workflow where the user
  > can interact with a GUI similar to the hosted Assisted installation service.

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Other Merged pull requests:

- [1032](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1032): (20/68) general: OpenShift CoreOS Layering (provisional) (cgwalters)

  > Change RHEL CoreOS as shipped in OpenShift to be a "base image" that can be used as in layered container builds and then booted.  This will allow custom 3rd party agents delivered via RPMs installed in a container build.  The MCO will roll out and monitor these custom builds the same way it does for the "pristine" CoreOS image today.
  >
  > This is the OpenShift integration of [ostree native containers](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainer) or [CoreOS layering](https://github.com/coreos/enhancements/pull/7) via the MCO.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 5 Other New pull requests:

- [1059](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1059): (179/179) baremetal: Converge ZTP and Metal3 flows (dtantsur)

  > This enhancement proposes converging two somewhat different bare-metal
  > provisioning flows in OpenShift:
  > - *Standard* Metal3 flow used in bare-metal IPI and [baremetal-operator][bmo].
  >   Uses the [Ironic agent][ipa] (also known as ironic-python-agent or
  >   simply IPA) for writing the CoreOS image.
  > - ZTP (Zero-Touch Provisioning) flow using the so-called *live ISO* Ironic and
  >   baremetal-operator feature, the assisted service and the assisted agent.

- [1062](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1062): (4/4) storage: Update the CSI migration enhancement (bertinatto)

  `do-not-merge/hold`

  > We want to allow cluster administrators to seamlessly migrate volumes created using the in-tree storage plugin to their counterpart CSI drivers. It is important to achieve this goal before CSI Migration feature becomes GA in upstream. This also a requirement for supporting [out-of-tree cloud providers](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/463)

- [1063](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1063): (3/3) installer: add stage-based exit codes to the openshift-installer (deads2k)

  > `openshift-installer` callers will now get more granular exit codes.
  > Callers of `openshift-installer` can expect non-zero exit codes *that may change over time* as
  > the `openshift-installer` evolves over time.
  > `openshift-installer` provides *no guarantee* that exit codes will not change as result of changes like
  > greater granularity, lower granularity, re-organization, or other needs.
  > `openshift-installer` *does guarantee* that a particular exit code will not be re-used to have a
  > different meaning in the same y-level version.
  > `openshift-installer` will make reasonable efforts to avoid re-using a particular exit code to have
  > different meanings across y-level versions, but for sufficiently compelling reasons may do so.

- [1064](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1064): (3/3) network: Add enhancement proposal for SDN live migration (pliurh)

  > Migrating the CNI network provider network of a running cluster from
  > OpenShift SDN to OVN Kubernetes without service interruption. During the
  > migration, we will partition the cluster into two sets of nodes controlled by
  > different network plugins. We will utilize the Hybrid overlay feature of
  > OVN Kubernetes to connect the networks of the two CNI network plugins. So that
  > pods on each side can still talk to the pods on the other side.
