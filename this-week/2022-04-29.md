*Updates since 2022-04-22*


## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized Active pull request:

- [1067](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1067): (57/367) agent-installer: Automated Workflow for Agent-based Installer (dhellmann) ([AGENT-10](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AGENT-10))

  `tide/merge-method-squash, priority/important-soon`

  > "Cluster 0" deployments, for the first cluster in an environment, are
  > unique because they occur in situations where there may not be a lot
  > of other infrastructure to support long-running services normally
  > associated with automated provisioning for on-premises use
  > cases. Nevertheless, users and partners want to automate these
  > deployments. The assisted installer GUI provides an excellent user
  > experience for deploying connected clusters. This enhancement covers
  > the *user-provided automation* use case for disconnected clusters.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 6 Other Merged pull requests:

- [1023](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1023): (5/39) ingress: NE-881: ingress: Add route-subdomain enhancement (Miciah) ([NE-700](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-700))

  > This enhancement implements the `spec.subdomain` field of the OpenShift Route
  > API.  When `spec.host` is specified or `spec.subdomain` is omitted on a Route,
  > then the Route API behaves the same as before this enhancement.  When
  > `spec.host` is omitted and `spec.subdomain` is specified, the host name of the
  > Route depends on the domain of the IngressController that exposes the Route.  If
  > multiple IngressControllers expose a Route that specifies `spec.subdomain`, then
  > the Route has a distinct host name for each IngressController that exposes it.
  > This is particularly useful with sharding where the Route is exposed on multiple
  > shards.  It is also useful generally in situations where the user wants to
  > specify the subdomain part of the Route's host name but allow the
  > IngressController to set the domain part.

- [1035](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1035): (2/143) network: Pods Egress DSCP QoS proposal (oribon) ([SDN-2097](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-2097))

  > Not all traffic has the same priority, and when there is contention for bandwidth, there should be a mechanism for objects outside the cluster to prioritize the traffic.
  > To enable this, we will use Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) which allows us to classify packets by setting a 6-bit field in the IP header, effectively marking the priority of a given packet relative to other packets as "Critical", "High Priority", "Best Effort" and so on.
  >
  > By introducing a new CRD `EgressQoS`, users could specify a DSCP value for packets originating from pods on a given namespace heading to a specified CIDR.
  > The CRD will be Namespaced, with one resource allowed per namespace.
  > The resources will be watched by ovn-k, which in turn will configure OVN's [QoS Table](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/ovn-nb.5.html#QoS_TABLE).

- [1098](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1098): (8/8) release: proposals for improving CI signal (stbenjam) ([edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16E0dLFLbLBTe0J4fUd_55I-8bJc9t22BwsdWqFuutaQ/edit))

  > We are currently highly susceptible to regression in the quality of our payloads. This is due to a few factors:
  >
  > - We can’t (too much time, too expensive) run all our CI jobs against all PRs pre-merge, so sometimes we don’t find out
  >   something regressed until after the PR merges
  >
  > - Even our payload acceptance jobs assume that they will sometimes fail and therefore set the bar at “at least one
  >   pass”. This allows changes which make tests less reliable to go undetected as long as we keep getting an occasional
  >   pass.
