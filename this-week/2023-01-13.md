There was 1 Prioritized New pull request:

- [1312](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1312): (13/13) microshift: USHIFT-734: MicroShift Upgrade and Rollback (oglok) ([USHIFT-518](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-518))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > Allow successful upgrades of MicroShift running on Edge Devices and enable
  > the ability of going back to a previous working state. To support this process,
  > MicroShift relies on the transactional features of OSTree by atomically
  > switching between states.

There were 3 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [1306](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1306): (64/131) microshift: USHIFT-319: Integrating MicroShift with Greenboot enhancement proposal (ggiguash) ([USHIFT-319](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-319))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > Assure successful software upgrades and system configuration changes on Edge
  > Devices running MicroShift by using [greenboot](https://github.com/fedora-iot/greenboot),

  > This enhancement proposes making some of the core components like CNI and CSI
  > optional and pluggable.
  >
  > In the enhancement proposal we will describe an architecture which would allow
  > customers to install individual components as rpm packages, as well as some
  > alternative implementations.

- [1242](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1242): (12/140) microshift: ETCD-318: Adding MicroShift etcd enhancement (dusk125) ([ETCD-318](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ETCD-318))

  `tide/merge-method-squash, priority/important-soon`

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 6 Other New pull requests:

- [1310](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1310): (21/21) agent-installer: AGENT-436: Propose interactive network config for agent-based installer (zaneb) ([AGENT-385](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AGENT-385))

  > Enable the user, after booting the agent ISO, to interactively add or correct
  > any neccessary network configuration. Since we cannot rely on network
  > connectivity for this step, configuration will be via a text user interface
  > (TUI) displayed on the console.

- [1311](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1311): (3/3) ingress: Proposal to add API field to configure default name of session cookies in HAProxy router (dudinea) ([AAA-NNN"](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AAA-NNN"))

  `needs-ok-to-test`

  > The OpenShift router uses cookies to provide session persistence. The
  > name of the cookie is automatically generated by HAProxy unless this
  > behavior is overridden by per-route annotations
  > (router.openshift.io/cookie_name,
  > haproxy.router.openshift.io/disable_cookies, see
  > https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/networking/routes/route-configuration.html#nw-using-cookies-keep-route-statefulness_route-configuration).
  >
  > This enhancement proposes to add an API field `spec.cookieName` to the
  > `IngressController` CRD that will allow to configure default name of
  > session cookies.

- [1313](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1313): (2/2) network: Update Egress Services enhancement (oribon) ([SDN-2682](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-2682))

  > Some external systems that communicate with applications running on the Kubernetes cluster through a LoadBalancer service expect that the source IP of egress traffic originating from the pods backing the service is identical to the destination IP they use to reach them - i.e the LoadBalancer's ingress IP.
  > This behavior requires that service access from outside the cluster will only work to a designated node. This is contradictory to how default services work where a service may be accessed via any node.
  >
  > By introducing a new CRD `EgressService`, users could request that the source IP of egress packets originating from all of the pods that are endpoints of a LoadBalancer service would be its ingress IP.
  > The CRD will be Namespaced, each named as the LoadBalancer Service that should be modified.

- [1314](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1314): (2/2) ingress: NE-366: Ingress: Amend Ingress log level enhancement (rfredette)

  > This enhancement describes the API and code changes necessary to expose
  > a means to change the Ingress Operator and OpenShift Router's Logging Levels to
  > cluster administrators.

- [1315](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1315): (2/2) installer: enhancements/installer/component-selection: Clarify cluster-bot testing (wking) ([OCPPLAN-7589](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-7589))

  > This enhancement proposes a mechanism for cluster installers to exclude one or more optional components
  > (capabilities) for their installation which will determine which payload components are/are not installed
  > in their cluster.  Core components are defined as the set of Second Level Operators managed by the Cluster
  > Version Operator which today cannot be disabled until after completing the install and editing a CVO
  > override, or editing the CVO overrides as part of rendering+editing manifests.  In addition, using CVO
  > overrides put the cluster into an unsupported and un-upgradeable state, making it insufficient as a solution.
  >
  > The proposed UX is to make this a first class part of the install config api with the implementation
  > being arguments supplied to the CVO to filter out the user-selected manifests based on groupings called
  > capabilities.

- [1316](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1316): (2/2) microshift: Add MicroShift Service of Loadbalancer Type Support (pliurh) ([NP-604](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NP-604))

  > Customers using loadbalancer type Service, doesn't want to make changes to their
  > workloads/deployment for MicroShift as they use other k8s flavors as well. It is
  > also promised by us that users do not have to modify workload manifests that
  > work on OpenShift to run on MicroShift (as long as they do not use APIs
  > unsupported by MicroShift).
