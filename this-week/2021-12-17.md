There were 4 Other Merged pull requests:

- [837](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/837): (13/146) insights: Conditional Data Gathering for Insights Operator (Sergey1011010)

  > The conditional gatherer for Insights Operator collects data according to the defined gathering rules*.
  > Each rule contains one or more conditions such as "alert A is firing"
  > and one or more gatherers with parameters such as "collect X lines of logs from containers in namespace N".
  > Current version has these rules defined in the code and the proposal is to load them from an external source
  > to make collection of new conditional data faster. It's NOT about running brand new code,
  > but just calling the existing gatherers with different validated parameters, so the operator can't
  > collect anything we don't expect.
  >
  > \* note that rule here and later has nothing to do with rules used to analyze data in archives written
  > by CCX presentation team

- [962](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/962): (8/347) windows-containers: WINC-505: Windows containerd runtime enablement (selansen)

  > This enhancement intends to allow customers to bring up Windows nodes with containerd
  > as the default runtime from OpenShift 4.11 onwards. When customers upgrade clusters to
  > OpenShift 4.11, container runtime will be migrated from Docker to containerd

- [986](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/986): (2/2) windows-containers: WIP WINC-712: Windows CSI Storage Enablement (alinaryan)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > The intent of this enhancement is to allow customers to provision CSI storage
  > in Windows Containers in 4.10+ using the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO).
  > CSI drivers are typically deployed as privileged containers in order to perform
  > storage related operations. Windows does not currently support privileged
  > containers. CSIProxy makes it so that node plugins can be deployed as
  > unprivileged pods and then use the proxy to perform privileged storage
  > operations on the node.

- [987](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/987): (2/2) dns: Add the DNS-over-TLS enhancement intial draft (brandisher)

  > This enhancement adds optional configuration to enable DNS-over-TLS when
  > either `spec.servers[].forwardPlugin` and/or `spec.upstreamResolvers` are
  > configured in the cluster DNS spec.

- [989](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/989): (26/26) machine-api: [OCPCLOUD-1373] Add AWS EFA Networking enhancement (JoelSpeed)

  > AWS Elastic-Fabric-Adapter (EFA) is a feature within EC2 that allows for high throughput network adapters to be
  > attached to certain instance types. With the presence of these network adapters and some additional drivers,
  > workloads can take advantage of greatly improved network performance between nodes within the same AWS availability
  > zone.

- [990](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/990): (59/59) windows-containers: Windows Health Management enhancement (sebsoto)

  > The purpose of this enhancement is to ensure that all Windows nodes managed by the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO)
  > maintain a usable state. With health management implemented, WMCO will automatically ensure that OpenShift related services
  > running on the underlying Windows VMs have a status and runtime configuration inline with the expectations of the installed operator version.
