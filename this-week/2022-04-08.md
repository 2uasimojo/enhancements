## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized Active pull request:

- [1067](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1067): (22/236) agent-installer: Automated Workflow for Agent-based Installer (dhellmann)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > "Cluster 0" deployments, for the first cluster in an environment, are
  > unique because they occur in situations where there may not be a lot
  > of other infrastructure to support long-running services normally
  > associated with automated provisioning for on-premises use
  > cases. Nevertheless, users and partners want to automate these
  > deployments. The assisted installer GUI provides an excellent user
  > experience for manually deploying clusters. This enhancement covers
  > the *automation* use case.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 9 Other Merged pull requests:

- [937](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/937): (3/161) monitoring: support configuration of alerting notifications by application owners (simonpasquier)

  > This document describes a solution that allows OpenShift users to route alert
  > notifications without cluster admin intervention. It complements the existing
  > [user-workload monitoring stack][uwm-docs], enabling a full self-service experience for
  > workload monitoring.

- [943](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/943): (5/114) etcd: [OCPCLOUD-1244] Add proposal for etcd protection mechanism during control plane scaling (JoelSpeed)

  > To enable automation of Control Plane scaling activities, in particular vertical scaling of the Control Plane Machines,
  > we must implement a mechanism that protects etcd quorum and ensures the smoothest possible transition as new etcd
  > members are added and old members removed from the etcd cluster.

- [1034](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1034): (10/226) agent-installer: Agent Installer Development Environment (lranjbar)

  > Create a development environment for the ephemeral agent based installer image in the
  > [dev-scripts](https://github.com/openshift-metal3/dev-scripts) repository and refactor
  > components as needed for the new project. In addition we will add base case e2e test flows
  > integrated into Openshift CI to get the project started.

- [1056](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1056): (11/122) cluster-scope-secret-volumes: BUILD-406: shared resource validating admission EP (gabemontero)

  > This Enhancement Proposal details improvements to existing validations currently performed, as well as the introduction
  > of new validations to be performed, on artifacts related to the Shared Resource CSI Driver and Operator component introduced
  > as Tech Preview in 4.10.  As a quick reminder, the associated API for "Shared Resources", namely SharedSecrets and SharedConfigMaps, are
  > cluster scoped objects whose referenced namespace scoped Secrets and Configmaps are mounted into Pod Spec'able objects
  > via use of the associated Shared Resource CSI Driver.
  >
  > With the introduction of the Shared Resources API in 4.10, any restrictions around use of the new CRDs or the declaring
  > of Volumes using the new Driver in Pods, was done at the CSI Driver level.  That is often not the
  > most efficient location to enforce such restrictions, as the entire Kubelet provisioning path for the Pod must be exercised
  > for the error to be caught.  Also, the user does not learn of the error upon creation of the Pod Spec'able object.
  > Instead, the user must inspect Pod status and Events to learn of the problem.
  >
  > This proposal intends to improve on the usability around error discovery by employing validations called during API object
  > creation and modification.

- [1069](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1069): (6/36) dev-guide: Add notes to explain how API fields should be documented in conventions (JoelSpeed)

  > As an API reviewer, I would like to see thorough documentation added to new API fields so that I can understand the mechanics of the changes we are adding to our API and so that customers can understand how they can and can't use the new fields.
  >
  > To encourage better documentation on ur APIs, I think we should add some notes to the conventions prompting users with a number of questions to think about when writing their godoc and some examples of how this might look in practice.
  >
  > This is a first draft of this to gather initial feedback:
  > - Is this the right location for this kind of content?
  > - What other questions should users be asked when writing their godoc
  > - Do we have any other recommendations about godoc that aren't already noted
  >
  > ToDo:
  > - [x] Add more examples of where the godoc is used
  > - [x] Provide example of godoc output for examples to help authors understand what the user might see
  > - [x] Clarify any language guidance we have for writing these godoc (Eg should we follow product doc styling)
  > - [x] Confirm we want to split out an official API conventions/style guide

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Other New pull requests:

- [1084](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1084): (2/2) ingress: enhancement/ingress: add max connections tuning (frobware)

  > Enable administrators to tune the maximum number of simultaneous
  > connections for OpenShift router deployments.
  >
  > OpenShift router currently hard-codes the maximum number of
  > simultaneous connections that HAProxy can handle to 20000, and it has
  > done so for all OpenShift v4 releases up to and including 4.10. It
  > should be possible for administrators to tune this value based on the
  > capability and sizing of their infrastructure nodes. Increasing the
  > maximum number of simultaneous connections will improve router
  > throughput at the expense of increased memory usage. Equally,
  > decreasing the current value may be of interest for Single Node
  > OpenShift (SNO) deployments. This proposal extends the existing
  > IngressController API to add a tuning option for max connections.
