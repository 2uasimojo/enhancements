  > running on AWS.
  > Currently by default CLB/ELB is set by default by the cluster-ingress-operator.

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > Change RHEL CoreOS as shipped in OpenShift to be a "base image" that can be used as in layered container builds and then booted.  This will allow custom 3rd party agents delivered via RPMs installed in a container build.  The MCO will roll out and monitor these custom builds the same way it does for the "pristine" CoreOS image today.
  >
  > This is the OpenShift integration of [ostree native containers](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainer) or [CoreOS layering](https://github.com/coreos/enhancements/pull/7) via the MCO.
