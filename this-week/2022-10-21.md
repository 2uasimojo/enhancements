### Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Merged pull requests:

- [1148](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1148): (15/128) installer: This proposal describes how we would add a new field to the install-config during installation to set the load balancer type in AWS either to NLB or ELB. (miheer) ([NE-942](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-942))

  > With this enhancement, the user can specify the AWS ELB type to be either Classic or NLB in the install-config, and this preference is stored in the cluster ingress config object.
  > This preference is used to deploy the default ingress controller with the user-specified load-balancer type for OpenShift clusters
  > running on AWS.
  > The install-time preference is also used for user-created ingress controllers on which no preference for load-balancer type is specified.
  > This enhancement does not change the default load-balancer type, which is Classic ELB.

- [1198](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1198): (4/92) insights: VDPA enhancement (lmilleri)

  > This enhancement provides a proposal for integrating vDPA (Virtio Data Path Acceleration) in Openshift.
