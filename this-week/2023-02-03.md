## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized Merged pull request:

- [1320](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1320): (28/157) microshift: USHIFT-716: Microshift API server certificate handling (pacevedom) ([USHIFT-716](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-716))

  > This enhancement proposes a strategy to manage kube API server certificates
  > in all environments where MicroShift might be deployed, both externally
  > (accessible through kubeconfig) and internally (pods reaching the API server).
  >
  > > Anytime the document mentions API server, it refers to kube API server.
  >
  > MicroShift has a wide variety of different use cases when it comes to API
  > server connectivity, we can find environments where the cluster needs to be
  > reachable with the IP, with the hostname, by some other name having DNS, or
  > a combination of them.


### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [1304](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1304): (14/259) microshift: USHIFT-599 Make MicroShift core components pluggable (mangelajo) ([USHIFT-599](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-599))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes making some of the core components like CNI and CSI
  > optional and pluggable.
  >
  > In the enhancement proposal we will describe an architecture which would allow
  > customers to install individual components as rpm packages, as well as some
  > alternative implementations.

- [1306](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1306): (2/179) microshift: USHIFT-319: Integrating MicroShift with Greenboot enhancement proposal (ggiguash) ([USHIFT-319](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-319))

  `priority/important-soon, jira/valid-reference`

  > Assure successful software upgrades and system configuration changes on Edge
  > Devices running MicroShift by using [greenboot](https://github.com/fedora-iot/greenboot),
  > the Generic Health Check Framework for `systemd` on `rpm-ostree` based systems.

- [1312](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1312): (1/84) microshift: USHIFT-734: MicroShift Upgrade and Rollback (oglok) ([USHIFT-518](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-518))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > Allow successful upgrades of MicroShift running on Edge Devices and enable
  > the ability of going back to a previous working state. To support this process,
  > MicroShift relies on the transactional features of OSTree by atomically
  > switching between states.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Other Merged pull requests:

- [1303](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1303): (17/168) ingress: Add gateway-api enhancement (Miciah) ([NE-1105](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-1105)) ([NE-1107](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-1107)) ([NE-1108](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-1108))

  > This enhancement extends the Ingress Operator to install and manage the Gateway
  > API CRDs and the OpenShift Service Mesh Operator, which manages Istio and Envoy.
  > This new capability of the Ingress Operator enables a cluster admin to configure
  > Istio/Envoy using Gateway API's GatewayClass and Gateway custom resources and
  > enables project admins to configure Envoy using Gateway API's HTTPRoute custom
  > resource.  (In the future, other Gateway API custom resources will be supported
  > as APIs stabilize and Istio adds support for them.)  The end result is a
  > comprehensive turnkey solution very much like what is possible today using
  > OpenShift's IngressController and Route APIs but with the advantage of using
  > Gateway API, which is the up-and-coming Kubernetes community standard API for
  > configuring cluster ingress.

- [1333](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1333): (4/4) dns: Add OWNERS files for Network Edge areas (Miciah)

  > Add `OWNERS` files for DNS- and ingress-related enhancements.
  >
  > * `enhancements/dns/OWNERS`:
  > * `enhancements/ingress/OWNERS`: New files.


#### Other Merged Pull Requests Modifying Existing Documents

- [1323](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1323): (9/11) general: OTA-787: enhancements/update/update-blocker-lifecycle: Port from Bugzilla to Jira (wking)

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 6 Other New pull requests:

- [1327](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1327): (7/7) baremetal: Enable CBO on AWS platform (elfosardo) ([METAL-300](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/METAL-300))

  > Baremetal Host API is available when deploying an OpenShift cluster with the baremetal platform (via the IPI or AI (Assisted Installer) workflow) or with the on-premise platforms Openstack, vSphere, and None.
  > Adding the possibility to deploy and manage bare metal hosts from clusters not in an on-premise infrastructure would be beneficial to customers.

- [1328](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1328): (65/65) general: Custom Alert Configuration Enhancement (atiratree) ([CNV-15064](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-15064))

  > There is a need for a mechanism for a certain use cases, that would allow
  > OpenShift components to opt out kubernetes objects from being picked up by
  > alerts. The impact of missing this feature is felt most by users of KubeVirt
  > (OpenShift Virtualization). This feature should not be available to users
  > because it could disrupt existing alerting/monitoring. Users should use
  > alert silences instead.
