### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized Active pull request:

- [1067](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1067): (45/215) agent-installer: Automated Workflow for Agent-based Installer (dhellmann)

  `do-not-merge/hold, priority/important-soon`

  > "Cluster 0" deployments, for the first cluster in an environment, are
  > unique because they occur in situations where there may not be a lot
  > of other infrastructure to support long-running services normally
  > associated with automated provisioning for on-premises use
  > cases. Nevertheless, users and partners want to automate these
  > deployments. The assisted installer GUI provides an excellent user
  > experience for manually deploying clusters. This enhancement covers
  > the *automation* use case.

- [1036](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1036): (11/154) insights: Insights Operator Prometheus Alerts for Insights Recommendations (natiiix)

  > Insights recommendations are triggered based on data in the archives
  > periodically uploaded by the Insights Operator. A report about these
  > recommendations is available through the Insights Smart Proxy, and it is
  > currently fetched by the Insights Operator after each successful archive
  > upload in order for the Insights Operator to update Prometheus metrics
  > containing the number of currently active recommendations in each severity
  > category.
  >
  > This enhancement aims to extend this functionality by not only making the
  > number of recommendations available, but also providing specific information
  > about each of the recommendations via Prometheus alerts. The currently
  > suggested approach expects one info-level alert per active Insights
  > recommendation, containing its ID, human-readable name, severity, and a link
  > to detailed information about the recommendation and its remediation steps.

- [1039](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1039): (5/6) ingress: Add tunable-router-kubelet-probes (Miciah)

  > This enhancement allows cluster administrators to modify the liveness and
  > readiness probe timeout values of OpenShift router deployments.

- [1041](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1041): (63/246) single-node: Enhancement for enabling single-node-openshift with workers (omertuc)

  > This enhancement aims to enable adding workers to a single control-plane node
  > cluster by attempting to tackle multiple issues that arise when worker nodes
  > are added to such clusters.

  > For increasing security and add protection against open firewalls, reverse proxies, and SSRF vulnerabilities Amazon introduced
  > [enhancements to the EC2 Instance Metadata Service](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/defense-in-depth-open-firewalls-reverse-proxies-ssrf-vulnerabilities-ec2-instance-metadata-service/)
  > (IMDSv2). It is a session-based interaction method with Instance Metadata Service (IMDS), in other words,
  > all requests to `http://169.254.169.254` will require prior PUT requests for obtaining token and such token must be used in further requests.
  > This document describes and proposes several interfaces for configuring IMDS behaviour for newly created machines via Machine API and
