- [1342](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1342): (160/262) network: networking: Live migration for ovn-k + hypershift + kubevirt (qinqon) ([CNV-22946](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-22946))

  > The [Hypershift](https://hypershift-docs.netlify.app/) project creates openshift clusters on demand on top of already provisioned openshift by deploying  (and attaching working nodes to) "Hosted Control Planes" using one of different providers, such as aws, azure, baremetal (agent), and kubevirt.
  >
  > In KubeVirt's case, the worker nodes will be spun as KubeVirt virtual machines.
  >
  > There are some network requirements, some of them are imposed by kubevirt
  > live migration and others by kubernetes:
  >
  > - The IP Kubelet uses to register/communicate must follow the node during live migration.
  > - Guest Cluster Network isolation. Guest clusters shouldn’t be able to talk to other guest clusters directly except through public LBs. Guest clusters shouldn’t be able to talk to any infra components except through public LBs.
  > - No TCP connection breakage over E/W and N/S during live migration with minimal disruption.
  >   - Disruption for pre-copy live migration ~1sec
  >   - Disruption for post-copy live migration (this happend if libvirt activate the target domain before live migration finish) ~8sec
  > - Expose hosted cluster pods running at workers (VMs) using NodePort/LoadBalancer services at infra cluster.
  > - Allow workers services access to services like kubedns and apiserver from hosted control plane.
  >
  > To accomplish the goals listed above the ovn-kubernetes default network has to implement some features triggered for an Hypershift KubeVirt VM.

  > Allow OVS daemons to run on reserved and non-reserved CPUs if the network workload requires
  > cycles and non-reserved CPU are idle.

### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 11 New pull requests:

- [1395](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1395): (5/5) security: Support BMC CA Certificate (zhouhao3) ([RFE-3505](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RFE-3505))

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress, ok-to-test`

  > This enhancement allows users to provide local CA certificates for IPI
  > installation or subsequent node management, ensuring secure communication
  > with baremetal BMCs that use certificates issued by the local CA or use
  > self-signed certificates.

- [1396](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1396): (14/14) node-tuning: mixed-cpu-node-plugin (Tal-or) ([CNF-7603](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNF-7603))

  > Resources management (particularly CPUs) in Kubernetes/OpenShift is limited and not flexible enough to cover all of
  > our customer use cases.
  > This enhancement introduces a new node-plugin that operates at runtime-level
  > for extending CPU resources management on top of Kubernetes and OpenShift platforms.
  > With the existing CPU management design, a container can either request exclusive CPUs or shared CPUs,
  > while with this new node plugin, it would be possible for container workload to request for both.

- [1397](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1397): (50/50) installer: Installer: AWS Shared VPC (patrickdillon) ([CORS-2613](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CORS-2613)) ([OCPBU-558](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBU-558))

  > AWS [VPC sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html) allows a VPC
  > to be shared between multiple accounts. Accordingly, it is possible to configure a DNS private hosted
  > zone in one account (Account A) while cluster resources are installed in a different
  > account (Account B). This enhancement enables OpenShift installation with this cross-account shared-VPC
  > architecture by providing a solution to handle authentication to the private-hosted-zone account.

- [1400](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1400): (4/4) installer: CORS-2062: Allow Customers to BYO DNS (sadasu) ([CORS-1874](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CORS-1874))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > This feature provides OpenShift customers running on AWS an option to use a
  > custom DNS solution that is different from the default cloud DNS. OpenShift does
  > not have access to this custom DNS solution and hence is not expected to
  > configure it.

- [1401](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1401): (11/11) etcd: ETCD-425: adding etcd tuning profiles enhancement (dusk125)

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > This enhancement would replace the hardcoded values for the etcd parameters HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL and LEADER_ELECTION_TIMEOUT with predefined "profiles".
  > Each profile would map to predefined, and pretested, values for the internal etcd parameters.
  > This would allow for some user tweaking without giving them access to the full range of values.
  > This enhancement only covers the mvp for a tech preview release of this new feature; a future enhancement will be necessary.

- [1402](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1402): (38/38) api-review: [OCPNODE-1639] Add ImagePolicy to support signature verification (QiWang19) ([OCPNODE-1628](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPNODE-1628))

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > This enhancement propose an ImagePolicy CRD to provide a way to set sigstore image signature verification configuration on Openshift.

- [1403](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1403): (22/22) security: Consistent handling of SecurityContextConstraint RunAsAny strategy. (alanconway) ([OCPBUGS-13375](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-13375))

  > SecurityContextConstraints serve two distinct functions:
  >
  > 1. They _constrain_ Pod configurations that are allowed to run.
  > 2. They _modify_ Pod configurations with values from outside the Pod based on strategies in the SCC.
  >
  > From [the docs][scc]:
  > > The admission controller is aware of certain conditions in the security context constraints (SCCs) that trigger it to look up pre-allocated values from a namespace and populate the SC before processing the pod.
  >
  > SCC strategies are ordered by "restrictiveness": if a Pod runs under SCC X, then it MUST run under any SCC that is _less restrictive_ than X.
  > This ordering is critical to correctly matching SCCs to Pods, and must be clear an consistent.
  >
  > The `RunAsAny` strategy is documented as being the _least restrictive_ `runAsUser` strategy.
  > In other words, a Pod that runs under some other `runAsUser` strategy must also run under `RunAsAny`
  >
  > This is not currently the case for pods with `runAsNonRoot:true`. They run correctly under `MustRunAsRange` but fail under `RunAsAny`.
  > If a Pod has no `runAsUser` and no image `User` setting then:
  > - Under `MustRunAsRange`, SCC processing "helps" by providing a default non-root UID from a predefined range.
  > - Under `RunAsAny`, SCC processing does not help, and assumes the Docker default of 0. The Pod is rejected by its own security context.
  >
  > The proposal: For `runAsNonRoot:true` pods, `RunAsAny` should use the same defaulting rules as `MustRunAsRange` to provide a non-0 UID.

- [1404](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1404): (13/13) metadata: [CFE-840] Proposes metadata controller for user tag management on cloud resources (TrilokGeer)

  > Tagging cloud resources enable users to perform administrative operations like, organize the resources,
  > apply security policies, optimize operations, etc. The cloud resources can be tagged using cloud service provider tools,
  > kubernetes controllers that create resources via cloud service provider api and other open source tools. A reconciliation
  > using a generic metadata controller helps to keep the tags synchronized for cloud resources.
  >
  > In the following proposal, the controller supports mainly
  > 1. Day 2 operations and tag management for cloud resources selected using classifiers.
  > 2. Own the tag list and reconcile to replace any edits performed external to the controller.
  > 3. Opcodes in specification for handling user request as an operation on tag list.
  > 4. Extensible APIs and segregated configuration for controller and cloud provider specific configurations.
