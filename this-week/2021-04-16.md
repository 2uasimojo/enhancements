There were 2 Prioritized Revived (discussion after PR was merged) pull requests:

- [574](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/574): (1/567) installer: First iteration of running the Assisted Installer in end-user clusters. (mhrivnak)
- [703](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/703): (5/289) general: management workload partitioning (dhellmann)

### Prioritized Active Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [636](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/636): (2/59) kube-apiserver: API Removal Notifications (sanchezl)

  > Notify customers that an API that will be removed in the next release is in use.

- [643](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/643): (1/65) update: Add Reduced Reboots enhancement (sdodson)

  > This enhancement is intended to reduce host reboots when upgrading across two or
  > more OpenShift minor versions by enabling an N-2 version skew policy between all
  > host components and cluster scoped resources.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 7 Other Merged pull requests:

- [663](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/663): (4/25) dns: Add configurable-dns-pod-placement enhancement (Miciah)

  > The DNS operator in OpenShift 4.7 and prior versions manages a DaemonSet that
  > serves two functions: running CoreDNS and managing node hosts' `/etc/hosts`
  > files.  This enhancement, in OpenShift 4.8, replaces this single DaemonSet with
  > two: one DaemonSet for CoreDNS and one DaemonSet for managing `/etc/hosts`.
  > Additionally, this enhancement adds an API to enable cluster administrators to
  > configure the placement of the CoreDNS Pods.

- [669](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/669): (4/49) console: Add Customize Add Page proposal (jerolimov)

  > Cluster admins want to customize the add page of the OpenShift Developer Console.
  >
  > This list contains a long list of actions, some of them depends on installed operators like the OpenShift Pipelines Operator, the OpenShift Serverless Operator, and others.

- [675](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/675): (3/4) operator-sdk: enhancements: Fix various links in the downstream operator-sdk proposal (timflannagan)

  > The Operator SDK currently ships the Ansible and Helm Operator base images
  > downstream. The purpose of this enhancement is to add a supported Operator SDK
  > base image as well as an operator-sdk binary. In addition, to add more
  > automation to syncing upstream with downstream.

- [710](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/710): (6/74) cluster-logging: New enhancment proposal: forward-to-Loki (alanconway)

  > Add a new output type to the `ClusterLogForwarder` API to forward logs to a Loki instance.
  > An important part of using Loki is choosing the right _Loki labels_ to define log streams.
  > We present a default set of Loki labels, and explain how the choice of labels affect performance and queries.

- [718](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/718): (5/44) general: Introduce HA conventions for platform components (ravisantoshgudimetla)

  > This PR introduces HA conventions for platform specific operators/operands
  >
  > cc @smarterclayton

- [728](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/728): (1/3) general: management-workload-partitioning: fix typo in annotation name (dhellmann)

  > This enhancement describes an approach to allow us to isolate the
  > control plane services to run on a restricted set of CPUs. This will
  > be especially useful for resource-constrained enviornments, such as
  > single-node production deployments, where the user wants to reserve
  > most of the CPU resources for their own workloads and needs to
  > configure OpenShift to run on a fixed number of CPUs within the host.
  >
  > One example of this use case is seen in telecommunication service
  > providers implementation of a Radio Access Network (RAN). This use case
  > is discussed in more detail below.

#### Other merged

- [713](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/713): (2/3) ingress: Ingress: Post-implementation fixups for a couple of EPs (sgreene570)

### Other New Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Other New pull requests:

- [730](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/730): (7/7) network: mtu: ability to change running cluster's mtu setting (msherif1234)
- [732](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/732): (1/1) network: Add Smart NIC OVN offload enhancement (zshi-redhat)

  > OpenvSwitch (OVS) Hardware Offload with Nvidia ConnectX-5 improves OVS
  > dataplane performance by offloading processing of OVS OpenFlow flows to
  > hardware NIC. By integrating Nvidia BlueField2 SmartNIC support in OpenShift,
  > additional capabilities are added to accelerate and secure OVN control plane
  > in SmartNIC ARM processors.

- [733](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/733): (11/11) builds: Support Mounted Resource Volumes (adambkaplan)

  > Today builds support getting source input from configmaps and secrets, hereafter referred to as "resources".
  > When users utilize this feature, the resource is volume-mounted into the build pod and placed in the "build context" within the build's execution environment, alongside other build sources like git source code.
  > The next steps depend on whether it is an s2i or dockerfile build.
  >
  > For s2i builds, the generated Dockerfile contains commands to `ADD` the content at a path specified by the user, the assemble script is invoked, and then the injected content is zeroed out prior to committing the image via a `RUN rm` command added to the Dockerfile.
  >
  > For dockerfile builds, the user is instructed to add appropriate `ADD` and `RUN rm` commands to their dockerfile to inject the content that is available in the build's working directory (along with their application source, where applicable).
  >
  > There are a few undesirable aspects to this:
  >
  > 1. In the dockerfile case, the content can still be found in lower layers of the image unless a layer squashing option is selected.
  > 2. Requires extra work by the user in the Dockerfile, so each Dockerfile must be customized
  >
  > This enhancement proposes to introduce an option to use buildah's capability to mount a volume at build time.
  > The content mounted into the build pod would be then mounted into the container processing the Dockerfile, making that content available within the container so Dockerfile commands could reference it.
  > No explicit `ADD` would be required, and since mounted content is not committed to the resulting image, no `RUN rm` equivalent is required to clean up the injected content.
  >
  > To avoid security and lifecycle concerns, the following volume types will be supported initially:
  >
  > 1. Secrets
  > 2. ConfigMaps
  > 3. `csi` - this is to enable use of [Projected Resource CSI driver](/enhancements/cluster-scope-secret-volumes/csi-driver-host-injections.md) volumes.
