*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Merged pull requests:

- [1339](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1339): (56/550) cloud-integration: Tokenized Cloud Auth Enablement For Operators (bentito) ([OCPBU-4](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBU-4)) ([PORTENABLE-471](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PORTENABLE-471)) ([CCO-286](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CCO-286))

  > Many Cloud Providers offer services that allow authentication via Temporary Access Tokens (TAT).
  >
  > For example, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Secure Token Service (STS) allows you to request temporary limited-privilege
  > credentials. A concrete example is write permission on an S3 bucket on AWS. STS is supported on all the major cloud
  > providers where OpenShift is deployed.
  >
  > Currently, several Red Hat operators provide detailed instructions for how to use the operator on clusters where
  > Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is in Manual Mode, a mode where CCO is not capable of provisioning credentials on its
  > own. The process has manual operations performed by the customer that are inconsistent across layered product operators.
  >
  > This enhancement seeks to bring a unified set of standards and tooling to the process of enabling an
  > operator to access cloud provider resources using TAT, and improve the UX for consumers of these operators.

- [1407](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1407): (46/131) network: Networking: egress IP multi-NIC proposal (martinkennelly) ([SDN-1123](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-1123))

  > For OpenShift release version 4.13 or less, users may utilize egress IP to allow source NAT when packets leave OVN managed network
  > by specifying the source NAT IP within an `EgressIP` kubernetes custom resource definition.
  > This enhancement will add egress IP support for networks that exists on NICs that aren't managed by OVN and hence forth called
  > non-ovn managed networks.

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > The [Secrets Store CSI Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/secrets-store-csi-driver)
  > allows users to mount secrets from an external secret store (like Azure Key Vault for
  > example) as an ephemeral volume on a pod. This is done via a CSI driver that supports
  > ephemeral volumes, along with a provider plugin that communicates with the external
  > secret provider. This document describes how this driver can be deployed by an
  > optional operator on OpenShift.
