## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized New pull request:

- [1053](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1053): (64/64) agent-installer: Add agent-based installer concept (zaneb)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > The agent-based installer is an installation method that will use a bootable,
  > ephemeral installer image running on the hosts that are to become part of the
  > cluster. The user will generate the image using a command-line tool. The image
  > itself will contain components (such as
  > [assisted-service](https://github.com/openshift/assisted-service/#readme) and
  > [assisted-agent](https://github.com/openshift/assisted-installer-agent#readme))
  > of the Assisted and Multi-Cluster Engine (MCE) installation methods. The
  > installer will be usable in both a fully-automated workflow, where
  > configuration is provided upfront, and an interactive workflow where the user
  > can interact with a GUI similar to the hosted Assisted installation service.

There were 4 Other New pull requests:

- [1056](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1056): (25/25) cluster-scope-secret-volumes: BUILD-406: shared resource validating admission EP (gabemontero)

  > This Enhancement Proposal details improvements to existing validations currently performed, as well as the introduction
  > of new validations to be performed, on artifacts related to the Shared Resource CSI Driver and Operator component introduced
  > as Tech Preview in 4.10.  As a quick reminder, the associated API for "Shared Resources", namely SharedSecrets and SharedConfigMaps, are
  > cluster scoped objects whose referenced namespace scoped Secrets and Configmaps are mounted into Pod Spec'able objects
  > via use of the associated Shared Resource CSI Driver.
  >
  > With the introduction of the Shared Resources API in 4.10, any restrictions around use of the new CRDs or the declaring
  > of Volumes using the new Driver in Pods, was done at the CSI Driver level.  That is often not the
  > most efficient location to enforce such restrictions, as the entire Kubelet provisioning path for the Pod must be exercised
  > for the error to be caught.  Also, the user does not learn of the error upon creation of the Pod Spec'able object.
  > Instead, the user must inspect Pod status and Events to learn of the problem.
  >
  > This proposal intends to improve on the usability around error discovery by employing validations called during API object
  > creation and modification.

- [1057](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1057): (10/10) installer: Enhancement for enabling 4-node cluster deployments as a day0 operation (flaper87)

  > This enhancement proposes to allow for deploying a 4-nodes cluster as a day 0
  > operation, where the infrastructure workload can be deployed with HA enabled.
  > The 4-nodes cluster would be composed by 3 schedulable master nodes and a
  > single worker, which provide users with a highly available cluster.
