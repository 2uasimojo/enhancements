*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 5 Merged pull requests:

- [1417](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1417): (82/288) multi-arch: Support for Multiarch Manager Operator (Prashanth684) ([MIXEDARCH-215](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MIXEDARCH-215))

  > Recently, cloud vendors have started offering compute nodes leveraging different
  > CPU architectures. With the rising use and support of multi-architecture compute
  > nodes in Openshift clusters, users and cluster administrators face new
  > challenges when deploying workloads. Primarily, the scheduler does not consider
  > the images' compatibility with the CPU architectures when filtering nodes. We
  > must assume that the images used for deploying workloads would only support some
  > architecture the cluster could consist of. The typical workaround is to manually
  > add affinities to the pod spec to ensure that the pods land on nodes where the
  > image binaries can be executed. This strongly impacts the user experience: it
  > couples the set of compatible architectures at a given point in time to the pod
  > spec, does not scale well, and is challenging to maintain. The
  > `multiarch-manager-operator` aims to automate the inspection of the container
  > images, derive a set of architectures supported by a pod and use it to
  > automatically define strong predicates based on the `kubernetes.io/arch`
  > label in the pod's nodeAffinity.

### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 New pull requests:

- [1456](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1456): (107/107) network: DNM| WIP: SDN-4035: IPAM for VMs for OVN Kubernetes secondary networks (maiqueb) ([SDN-4035](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-4035))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > This enhancement proposal focuses on tying IP address allocation to Virtual
  > Machines instead of the pods where they run. In short, the IP allocation
  > should be available during the Virtual Machine lifecycle, rather than the
  > lifecycle of the pod where it runs on.

- [1457](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1457): (49/49) cluster-scope-secret-volumes: Shared Resources via OpenShift Builds Operator (adambkaplan)

  > Proposal to remove the Shared Resource CSI driver from OpenShift,
  > and deploy it via the OpenShift Builds operator instead. The
  > primary purpose of this document is to solicit feedback on this
  > approach. The CSI driver is currently marked as Tech Preview, and as
  > such does not require a proposal for its removal.
  >
  > The `CSIDriverSharedResource` feature in OCP will be marked as
  > deprecated in 4.15, with the intent of removal in 4.16. Clusters
  > which want to add this CSI driver will need to install the OpenShift
  > Builds operator first. Once installed, an admin will need to enable
  > the driver through the operator's configuration custom resource.
  >
  > Alternatives considered include keeping the CSI driver in OCP and
  > marking it GA, or deploying the CSI driver through its own operator
  > and corresponding layered product. The proposal details the disadvantage
  > of these approaches, and why removal from OCP was chosen as the path
  > forward.

- [1461](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1461): (3/3) cluster-api: OCPCLOUD-1910: Cluster API Install redesign (damdo) ([OCPCLOUD-1910](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPCLOUD-1910))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > This enhancement describes how we (the Cluster Infrastructure team) intend to rework the current Cluster API Install workflow, at the moment only available in Tech Preview, by addressing some of the criticalities of the current implementation, leveraging some of the lessons learned since the first Tech Preview release.
  >
  > The focus areas of this refactor are mainly around reducing complexity of the architecture and improving the development, stability and maintainability of Standalone Cluster API on OpenShift by preventing payload breakage due to non atomic repository merges, while maintaining the functionality provided up until now.
