# This Week in Enhancements - 2021-11-05

## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [862](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/862): (20/136) machine-api: Add Machine Deletion Hooks Proposal (JoelSpeed)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > Defines a set of annotations that can be applied to a Machine which can be used
  > to delay the actions taken by the Machine controller once a Machine has been marked
  > for deletion. These annotations are optional and may be applied during Machine
  > creation, sometime after Machine creation by a user, or sometime after Machine
  > creation by another controller or application, up until the Machine has been marked
  > for deletion.

- [838](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/838): (3/145) local-storage: KNIP-1770: Add proposal for exporting local storage device health metrics (rohantmp)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes that we export health metrics for each local device on each node.

- [867](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/867): (2/166) node-tuning: Move PAO to OCP enhancement (MarSik)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > The [Performance Addon Operator](https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators) is a component that makes it easier to configure an OCP cluster for low latency and real-time purposes [OCP docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/scalability_and_performance/cnf-performance-addon-operator-for-low-latency-nodes.html).
  > It is a high level orchestrator that consumes a [Performance Profile](https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators/blob/master/docs/interactions/performance-profile.yaml) and generates multiple manifests that are then processed by core OpenShift components like MCO and NTO.
  > We have a simplified interaction diagram here: https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators/blob/master/docs/interactions/diagram.png
  > A more in depth description of how a low latency tuned cluster works was presented at DevConf 2021: https://devconfcz2021.sched.com/event/gmJD/openshift-for-low-latency-and-real-time-workloads
  >
  > The proposal in hand is to move the existing implementation of PAO under
  > [cluster node tuning operator (NTO)](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-node-tuning-operator) without adding new features.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 5 Other Merged pull requests:

- [738](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/738): (39/185) general: Installing OCP on ARM-Based Smart NICs (danwinship)

  > As servers have greater and greater networking needs, hardware vendors have created increasingly more complex and powerful network cards. The latest iteration of this is "Smart NICs" that include an entire ARM system running Linux on the NIC. With such a NIC, we can offload nearly all network processing from the host computer onto the NIC "DPU" (Data Processing Unit), freeing up host CPU
  > resources for customer workloads (and allowing faster data transfer by ensuring the network stack doesn't need to compete for CPU with the customer workload).
  >
  > However, doing this requires installing and managing an appropriate software stack on all of the NICs in the cluster. This software will need to be kept in sync with the software on the host PC (eg, as new
  > functionality is added to OCP). The obvious answer to this problem is to run OpenShift on the NIC as well as on the host.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Other New pull requests:

- [949](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/949): (2/2) helm3: HELM-258: add enhancement for new namespace-scoped helm repo crd (zonggen)

  > Right now we support [`cluster-scoped` Helm repository CRD](https://github.com/openshift/api/blob/master/helm/v1beta1/0000_10-helm-chart-repository.crd.yaml#L17). This requires admin-level permissions when developers want to add a Helm repository in the OpenShift Console. We would like to add the ability to install Helm repository as a custom resource but with `scope: namespaced`.
