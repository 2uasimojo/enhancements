### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 New pull request:

- [1453](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1453): (3/3) network: ovn ns ipsec (yuvalk)

  `do-not-merge/hold`

  > The OVN Kubernetes network plugin uses [OVN](https://www.ovn.org) to instantiate
  > virtual networks for Kubernetes. These virtual networks use Geneve, a network
  > virtualization overlay encapsulation protocol, to tunnel traffic across the
  > underlay network between Kubernetes Nodes.
  >
  > IPsec is a protocol suite that enables secure network communications between
  > IP endpoints by providing the following services:
  > - Confidentiality
  > - Authentication
  > - Data Integrity
  >
  > OVN tunnel traffic is transported by physical routers and switches. These
  > physical devices could be untrusted (devices in public network) or might be
  > compromised. Enabling IPsec encryption for this tunnel traffic can prevent the
  > traffic data from being monitored and manipulated.
  >
  > The scope of this work is to encrypt all traffic between pods on the cluster
  > network when that traffic leaves the node (and correspondingly decrypt traffic
  > that enters the node) using IPsec. It will *not* encrypt traffic between pods on
  > the host network, as this traffic does not traverse OVN. However, as a side
  > effect, this will also encrypt pod traffic that originates from pods on the host
  > network and is destined for the cluster network as this network does traverse
  > OVN. In order to simplify terminology, this encrypted traffic will be referred
  > to as inter-node traffic throughout the document.
