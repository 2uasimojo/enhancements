- [1064](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1064): (36/279) network: Add enhancement proposal for SDN live migration (pliurh) ([SDN-2612](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-2612))

  > Migrating the CNI network provider network of a running cluster from
  > OpenShift SDN to OVN Kubernetes without service interruption. During the
  > migration, we will partition the cluster into two sets of nodes controlled by
  > different network plugins. We will utilize the Hybrid overlay feature of
  > OVN Kubernetes to connect the networks of the two CNI network plugins. So that
  > pods on each side can still talk to pods on the other side.

- [1402](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1402): (6/483) api-review: [OCPNODE-1639] Add ClusterImagePolicy, ImagePolicy to support signature verification (QiWang19) ([OCPNODE-1628](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPNODE-1628))

  > This enhancement introduces ClusterImagePolicy and ImagePolicy CRDs to independently manage configurations at the cluster and namespace scopes.

- [1483](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1483): (5/101) update: Don't require registry during reboot and upgrade (jhernand) ([RFE-4482](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RFE-4482))

  > Ensure that clusters don't require a registry server to reboot existing nodes or
  > upgrade when all the required images have already been pulled.

### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 New pull requests:

- [1500](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1500): (2/2) machine-config: Introduce machineconfiguration status enhancement (cdoern) ([MCO-452](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MCO-452))

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > This enhancement describes how MCO component progression should be aggregated into the machineconfiguration operator/v1 object. The goal here is to allow customers and the MCO team to decipher the our processes in a more verbose way, speeding up the debugging process and allowing for better customer engagement.

- [1502](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1502): (6/6) security: Create tls-artifacts-registry enhancement (vrutkovs) ([API-1603](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/API-1603))

  > This enhancement describes a single registry to store all produced
  > TLS artifacts. Both engineering and customers have expressed concern
  > about a lack of understanding what is the purpose of a particular
  > certificate or CA bundle, who issued it, and which team is responsible
  > for its contents and lifecycle. This enhancement describes a registry
  > to store necessary information about all certificates in the cluster
  > and sets requirements for TLS artifacts metadata.

- [1503](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1503): (2/2) cluster-logging: Add LokiStack tokenized auth proposal (periklis) ([OCPSTRAT-6](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPSTRAT-6)) ([OCPSTRAT-171 (AWS STS)](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPSTRAT-171 (AWS STS))) ([OCPSTRAT-114 (Azure WIF)](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPSTRAT-114 (Azure WIF))) ([OCPSTRAT-922 (GCP WIF)](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPSTRAT-922 (GCP WIF))) ([LOG-4540 (AWS & Azure)](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4540 (AWS & Azure))) ([LOG-4754 (GCP)](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4754 (GCP)))

  > Many Cloud Providers offer services that allow authentication via short-lived tokens assigned to limited set of privileges. Currently OpenShift supports provisioning tokenized authentication on all major Cloud Providers via the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO), i.e. AWS STS (4.14.0), Azure (4.14.z) and GCP (4.15.0).
  >
  > This enhancement seeks to bring a unified integration to configure LokiStack with CCO's capabilities to use tokenized authentication for accessing the respective Cloud Providers' object storage service. This improves the UX for consumers of the Loki Operator and in turn the Red Hat OpenShift Logging product.
