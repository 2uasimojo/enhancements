### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [862](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/862): (18/167) machine-api: Add Machine Deletion Hooks Proposal (JoelSpeed)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > Defines a set of lifecycle hooks that can be applied to a Machine which can be used
  > to delay the actions taken by the Machine controller once a Machine has been marked
  > for deletion. These hooks are optional and may be applied during Machine
  > creation, sometime after Machine creation by a user, or sometime after Machine
  > creation by another controller or application, up until the Machine has been marked
  > for deletion.

- [867](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/867): (9/182) node-tuning: Move PAO to OCP enhancement (MarSik)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > The [Performance Addon Operator](https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators) is a component that makes it easier to configure an OCP cluster for low latency and real-time purposes [OCP docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/scalability_and_performance/cnf-performance-addon-operator-for-low-latency-nodes.html).
  > It is a high level orchestrator that consumes a [Performance Profile](https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators/blob/master/docs/interactions/performance-profile.yaml) and generates multiple manifests that are then processed by core OpenShift components like MCO and NTO.
  >
  > The proposal in hand is to move the existing implementation of PAO under
  > [cluster node tuning operator (NTO)](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-node-tuning-operator) without adding new features.

There were 3 Other Merged pull requests:

- [881](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/881): (14/63) cluster-logging: LOG-1514: LokiStack CR extension for the gateway configuration (sasagarw)

  > LokiStack Gateway is a component deployed as part of Loki Operator. It provides secure access to Loki's distributor (i.e. for pushing logs) and query-frontend (i.e. for querying logs) via consulting an OAuth/OIDC endpoint for the request subject.
  >
  > This proposal provides an overview of the required LokiStack API changes to provide a per-tenant OIDC configuration for the LokiStack gateway component.

- [957](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/957): (42/42) update: describe how the CVO can support TechPreviewNoUpgrade (deads2k)

  > [TechPreviewNoUpgrade](https://github.com/openshift/api/blob/be1be0e89115702f8b508d351c4f5c9a16e5ae95/config/v1/types_feature.go#L32-L34)
  > is the canonical way to enable tech preview features.
  > It is the setting that all operators use to enable Tech Preview features.
  > The CVO will honor this setting on a per-manifest basis, so that tech preview manifests are never present on
  > non-tech preview clusters.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Other New pull request:

- [958](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/958): (27/27) monitoring: enhancements/monitoring: User-defined alerting rules proposal (bison)

  > The core OpenShift components ship a large number of Prometheus alerting rules.
  > A 4.10-nightly cluster on AWS currently has 175 alerts defined by default, and
  > enabling additional add-ons increases that number.  Still, users have repeatedly
  > asked for a supported method of adding additional custom rules, and adjusting
  > thresholds, or adding labels and annotations to existing platform alerting
  > rules.  These modifications are currently not possible, because the alerts are
  > managed by operators and cannot be modified, and the addition of custom rules is
  > explicitly unsupported at the moment.
