There were 4 Merged pull requests:

- [977](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/977): (8/48) worker-latency-profile: Add WorkerLatencyProfile enhancement (harche)

  > To make sure the Openshift cluster keeps running optimally where network latency between the control plane and the worker nodes may not always be at its best (e.g. Edge cases), we can tweak the frequency of the status updates done by the `Kubelet` and the corresponding reaction times of the `Kube Controller Manager` and `Kube API Server`.

### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 5 New pull requests:

- [1019](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1019): (3/3) node-tuning: Enhancement for improving image pull via shortname security (umohnani8)

  > Pulling images via shortnames is not very secure. There is a possibility of
  > spoofing where the image is pulled from as it goes through the list of `unqualified-search-registries`
  > checking for a match and pulls the image from the first location it is found in. With this method
  > there is no guarantee that the image is actually being pulled from the correct source.
  >
  > We have made this more secure by adding support for an alias table that has a list of shortname images
  > pointing to their fully qualified image name. This alias table is checked for a match whenever a pull
  > via shortname is attempted, which guarantees that the image will only be pulled from the location specified
  > in the alias table.

- [1020](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1020): (14/14) ingress: Add enhancement for AWS Load Balancer operator (arjunrn)

  > Users would like to use [Application Load
  > Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html)(ALBs)
  > for their Ingress resources so that they can use [Amazon Certificate
  > Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/)(ACM) to manage
  > certificates for the Ingress domains and also attach [Web Application
  > Firewalls](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/) to the ALB for security and traffic
  > shaping. The Openshift [router](github.com/openshift/router) uses an NLB which
  > passes through all traffic to the router. TLS termination is done on the router.
  > A WAF cannot be attached to the NLB and the router cannot be configured to
  > perform TLS termination at the NLB.

- [1021](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1021): (9/9) machine-api: [OCPCLOUD-1377] Add "Azure Ultra Disks support in Machine API" enhancement (damdo)

  > Enable OCP users to leverage Azure Ultra Disks on Machine API provisioned hosts on Azure via Data Disks or to attach them to Machines via Persistent Volumes (PVs).
