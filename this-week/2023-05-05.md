### Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Merged pull requests:

- [1301](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1301): (11/195) general: Azure Workload Identity (abutcher) ([CCO-187](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CCO-187))

  > Core OpenShift operators (e.g. ingress, image-registry, machine-api) use long-lived credentials to access Azure API services today. This enhancement proposes an implementation by which OpenShift operators would utilize short-lived, [bound service account tokens](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/authentication/bound-service-account-tokens.html) signed by OpenShift that can be
  > trusted by Azure as the `ServiceAccounts` have been associated with [Azure Managed Identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview). [Workload identity federation support for Managed Identities](https://github.com/Azure/azure-workload-identity/issues/325) was recently made public preview by Azure
  > ([announcement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview)) and is the basis for this proposal.

- [1372](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1372): (8/71) windows-containers: WINC-1007: Windows CSI Proxy enhancement proposal (sebsoto) ([OCPBU-465](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBU-465))

  > The goal of this enhancement is to enable the use of persistent storage for Windows workloads, without the use of
  > in-tree storage drivers, [which are in the process of being deprecated and removed.](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/09/26/storage-in-tree-to-csi-migration-status-update-1.25/)
  >
  > This will be done by running [CSI Proxy](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-proxy) as a Windows service on each
  > Windows node. csi-proxy is a pre-requisite for CSI node driver pods to interact with the underlying Windows storage
  > APIs. With csi-proxy running on a cluster's Windows nodes, cluster administrators are free to deploy the CSI storage
  > drivers of their choice as a Windows DaemonSet, enabling Windows pods on each node to have access to storage through
  > PersistentVolumeClaims.

- [1391](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1391): (3/3) authentication: WIP AUTH-372: enhancements/authentication: Custom SCC preemption prevention (s-urbaniak) ([AUTH-132](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AUTH-132))

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress, jira/valid-reference`

  > OpenShift ships SCCs by default that applies both to core OpenShift workloads
  > as well as to user provided workloads.
  >
  > In many cases the default out of the box SCCs are sufficient as they cover the most
  > common patterns for controlling permissions pods can have.
  > Additionally, the most recent enablement of Pod Security Admission also covers
  > an additional layer of protection next to OpenShift SCCs.
  >
  > However, OpensShift historically does allow cluster administrators to add
  > additional custom SCCs on top of the default out of the box SCCs.
  > Custom SCCs are not considered different from the perspective of
  > the SCC admission plugin.
  >
  > If a pod is admitted, the admission plugin lists all SCCs available in the system, including all custom SCCs.
  > The list of SCCs is then sorted by:
  > - SCC priority in descending order
  > - SCCs with the same priority: SCC restriction score in descending order (most restrictive first, least restrictive last)
  > - SCCs with the same restriction score: lexical ordering of the SCC name in descending order
  >
  > An SCC is considered applicable if the requesting user or the
  > pod's service account has `use` permissions against the `security.openshift.io.securitycontextconstraints` resource
  > for an SCC in the requested namespace.
  > If an SCC is applicable, the pod's manifest is potentially mutated according to the SCC logic.
  >
  > One can see that custom SCCs can easily overrule existing out of the box SCCs
  > if the pod's service account or the requesting user has sufficient privileges to use any of them.
  >
  > In that case, if a custom SCC has higher priority, is more restrictive, or it's name is lexically ordered before an out of the box SCC,
  > any OpenShift out of the box core pod will be mutated according to the custom SCC specified behavior.
  >
  > This can lead to unknown mutations of core OpenShift workloads.
  > Worst case it can render OpenShift core workloads dysfunctional
  > if i.e. a custom SCC is more restrictive than a previously applicable less restrictive out of the box SCC that was applicable to that workload.
