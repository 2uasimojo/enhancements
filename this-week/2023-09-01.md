### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 New pull requests:

- [1463](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1463): (4/4) network: Mutable dual-stack VIPs (mkowalski) ([OCPSTRAT-178](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPSTRAT-178)) ([OPNET-340](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OPNET-340)) ([OPNET-80](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OPNET-80))

  > Originally the on-prem loadbalancer architecture supported only single-stack IPv4 or IPv6 deployments. Later on, after dual-stack support was added to the on-prem deployments, a work has been done to allow installing clusters with a pair of virtual IPs (one per IP stack). This work however only covered installation-time, leaving clusters originally installed as single-stack and later converted
  > to dual-stack out of scope.
  >
  > This design is proposing a change which will allow adding a second pair of virtual IPs to clusters that became dual-stack only during their lifetime.

- [1465](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1465): (29/29) machine-api: OCPCLOUD-1578: Add enhancement for converting Machine API resource to Cluster API (JoelSpeed) ([OCPCLOUD-1578](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPCLOUD-1578))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > To enable OpenShift to migrate from the OpenShift Machine API to the upstream Kubernetes Cluster API project,
  > we will need to create a mechanism that allows users to continue using the existing API,
  > while we internally migrate to using Cluster API controllers.
  > We will also promote, via the addition of newer features, users to migrate to using the Cluster API directly,
  > which hopefully in turn will allow us to deprecate and eventually, remove (TBC[^1]) the Machine API.
  >
  > This document outlines the proposed method for that migration process.
  > This includes how Machines, MachineSets, MachineHealthChecks, the ControlPlaneMachineSet and the Cluster Autoscaler will be migrated.
  >
  > [^1]: To remove the Machine API we must prove that only a suitably small number of our customers are still using the API to manage their machines.
  > For example, if the number was suitably small that we could reach out to each customer individually to help them move, then it would be feasible.
  > For the purposes of this document and this project, we assume that the Machine API will exist in OpenShift 4 forever,
  > even though the backing implementation will move to Cluster API.

- [1466](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1466): (2/2) general: [TRACING-3490] enhancement proposal default observability service (frzifus)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > This proposal introduces a default telemetry proccessing and routing service,
  > for example named, `observability.openshift.local.svc`, designed to streamline
  > the collection and management of telemetry data from diverse workloads within
  > openshift clusters. Filtering and routing is be managed by cluster administrators
  > using kubernetes primitives (or maybe the OpenShift Console). The data can be
  > routed into default in-cluster storages and/or to third-party observability
  > providers. While another cluster with exposed observability service also counts
  > as a thrid party.

- [1468](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1468): (2/2) installer: Customer configured DNS for cloud platforms AWS, Azure and GCP (sadasu) ([CORS-1874](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CORS-1874))

  > This enhancement adds the ability to use a customer managed DNS solution for
  > API. APi-Int and Ingress resolution on AWS, Azure and GCP platforms during
  > OpenShift IPI installation. The default cloud provided DNS solutions will not
  > be used when this feature is in use.
