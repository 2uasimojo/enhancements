There were 3 Merged pull requests:

- [924](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/924): (8/220) oc: CLI Manager (deejross)

  > This proposal is describing the mechanism for how authors of a
  > Command Line Interface (CLI) tool such as `oc`, `kubectl`, `odo`,
  > `istio`, `tekton`, or `knative`, can deliver tools to OpenShift
  > clusters in disconnected environments.  A feature is needed to
  > manage various CLIs available for OpenShift and related
  > services. The goal is for a connected user to discover, install,
  > and upgrade tools that are compatible with the current cluster
  > version easily and from a single location.

### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 New pull requests:

- [1023](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1023): (4/4) ingress: Add route-subdomain enhancement (Miciah)

  > This enhancement implements the `spec.subdomain` field of the OpenShift Route
  > API.  When this field is specified, the host name of the Route depends on the
  > domain of the IngressController that exposes the Route.  If multiple
  > IngressControllers expose a Route that specifies `spec.subdomain`, then the
  > Route has a distinct host name for each IngressController that exposes it.  This
  > is particularly useful with sharding where the Route is exposed on multiple
  > shards.  It is also useful generally in situations where the user wants to
  > specify the subdomain part of the Route's host name but allow the
  > IngressController to set the domain part.

- [1025](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1025): (2/2) kube-apiserver: Introduce detection of stale clusteroperator conditions (mfojtik)

  > In OpenShift 4, every active operator included in the core payload (cluster operator) updates its conditions in "
  > clusteroperator" resource. Conditions determine whether specific core components are Degraded or Available or if they
  > are making progress or if their state causes the cluster to be not upgradeable. These conditions are essential for
  > cluster administrators to determine the health of their clusters, and they are usually the first thing Red Hat support
  > is going to look at in case there is a problem with the cluster.
  >
  > Unfortunately, in some edge cases, these conditions might not reflect the current state of the cluster. For example,
  > since they depend on the running operator, these conditions might become stale and outdated if the operator is not
  > running or cannot contact the API server. And while the API server might still work, the result
  > of `oc get clusteroperators` does not represent the cluster's current state.
  >
  > Therefore, we need a detection mechanism to help detect in-active operators or operators that are not actively updating
  > the conditions.
