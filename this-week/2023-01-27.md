  `do-not-merge/hold, priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes a strategy to manage kube API server certificates
  > in all environments where MicroShift might be deployed, both externally
  > (accessible through kubeconfig) and internally (pods reaching the API server).
  >
  > > Anytime the document mentions API server, it refers to kube API server.
  >
  > MicroShift has a wide variety of different use cases when it comes to API
  > server connectivity, we can find environments where the cluster needs to be
  > reachable with the IP, with the hostname, by some other name having DNS, or
  > a combination of them.

## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Other Merged pull requests:

- [1163](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1163): (52/187) installer: Installer: user-encrypted storage keys enhancement (patrickdillon) ([CORS-2049](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CORS-2049)) ([OCPPLAN-9307](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-9307))

  > When user-managed encryption keys are provided at install time, the default storage
  > class should be set to utilize those keys. Presently, only root volumes for nodes are
  > encrypted with those keys--but users would expect the persistent storage volumes to
  > be encrypted as well. This enhancement proposes a solution for AWS, GCP, & Azure.

- [1191](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1191): (19/314) api-review: CFE-543 : Apply user defined tags to all Azure resources created by OpenShift (bharath-b-rh) ([OCPPLAN-8155](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-8155)) ([CORS-2249](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CORS-2249))

  > This enhancement describes the proposal to allow an administrator of Openshift to
  > have the ability to apply user defined tags to those resources created by Openshift
  > in Azure.

- [1213](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1213): (26/286) workload-partitioning: feat: add wide cluster configuration for workload partitioning (eggfoobar) ([CNF-5562](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNF-5562))

  > This enhancements builds on top of the [Management Workload
  > Partitioning](management-workload-partitioning.md) and the [move of PAO in
  > NTO](../node-tuning/pao-in-nto.md) enhancement to provide the ability to do
  > workload partitioning to our wider cluster configurations. The previous workload
  > partitioning work is isolated to Single Node cluster configurations, this
  > enhancement will seek to allow customers to configure workload partitioning on
  > HA as well as Compact(3NC) clusters.


### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Other New pull requests:

- [1322](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1322): (51/51) network: [OCPBU-156] enhancement proposal for external loadbalancer (EmilienM) ([OCPBU-156](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBU-156))

  > Originally the on-premise IPI architecture was designed to deploy an internal
  > loadbalancer based on HAproxy, Keepalived and CoreDNS.
  > When customers needed more flexibility for the VIPs management, they would
  > deploy with the UPI method.
  >
  > This design is proposing the support for using an external loadbalancer
  > for the API and Ingress VIPs, so this can be managed outside of the cluster,
  > by the customer.
