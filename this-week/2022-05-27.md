### Prioritized New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized New pull request:

- [1125](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1125): (32/32) agent-installer: AGENT-40: Enhancement for generating admin kubeconfig (zaneb) ([AGENT-40](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AGENT-40))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > We will generate the admin kubeconfig file in the agent installer at the same
  > time as the agent ISO. The CA keys used to sign the client certificate in the
  > kubeconfig will be added to the ISO and eventually installed into the cluster
  > so that the credentials in the admin kubeconfig will be accepted.

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 13 Other Merged pull requests:

- [987](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/987): (5/129) dns: Add the DNS-over-TLS enhancement initial draft (brandisher) ([NE-703](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-703))

  > This enhancement adds optional configuration to enable DNS-over-TLS when
  > either `spec.servers[].forwardPlugin` and/or `spec.upstreamResolvers` are
  > configured in the cluster DNS spec.

- [1009](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1009): (24/137) general: OpenStack Cloud Provider Config Upgrade (stephenfin) ([OSASINFRA-2758](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSASINFRA-2758))

  > Cloud configuration is stored in the user-managed config map
  > `cloud-provider-config` in `openshift-config`.  In 4.12 we want to switch
  > OpenStack clusters from the legacy cloud provider (part of KCM) to the external
  > Cloud Controller Manager (CCM). The configuration for the legacy and external
  > cloud providers are similar, but not identical.
  >
  > This enhancement will describe how we can ensure correct configuration is passed
  > to the cloud provider in use during and after an upgrade, and how we can prevent
  > an upgrade to 4.12 if the configuration cannot be upgraded.

- [1030](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1030): (20/189) monitoring: enhancements/monitoring: User-Defined Alerting and Relabeling Rules (bison) ([MON-1985](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MON-1985))

  > The core OpenShift components ship a large number of Prometheus alerting rules.
  > A 4.10-nightly cluster on AWS currently has 175 alerts defined by default, and
  > enabling additional add-ons increases that number.  Still, users have repeatedly
  > asked for a supported method of adding additional custom rules, adjusting
  > thresholds, or adding and modifying labels on existing platform alerting rules
  > -- for example, changing severity labels.
  >
  > These modifications are currently not possible, because the alerts are managed
  > by operators and cannot be modified, and the addition of custom rules is
  > explicitly unsupported at the moment.  This proposal outlines a solution for
  > allowing additional user-defined rules and relabeling operations on existing
  > platform alerting rules.

- [1037](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1037): (3/531) insights: New Insights config API proposal (tremes) ([CCXDEV-6852](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CCXDEV-6852))

  > This enhancement introduces new Insights API resources. The new API will introduce new configuration options (including an option to force the data gathering as well as to disable it completely) as well as status reporting of the Insights operator.

- [1071](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1071): (4/34) baremetal: Add bootstrap-external-ip (honza) ([METAL-175](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/METAL-175))

  > When installing a bare metal IPI cluster, you can use the `networkConfig` field
  > in the `install-config.yaml` file to configure the control plane network
  > interfaces for the cluster hosts.  However, currently, you cannot configure the
  > bootstrap VM networking using the same means.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 8 Other New pull requests:

- [1121](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1121): (4/4) general: Observability Query Language (preliminary draft, incomplete) (alanconway)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > Different observability signal types may be stored in different stores, with different query languages.
  > In order to correlate different signal types, a "correlation service" must query multiple stores.
  > This proposal describes a common query language (ObsQL) that can be mapped to the native query language of each store.

- [1126](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1126): (26/26) cluster-logging: Logs-based alerts (periklis) ([LOG-2510](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2510))

  > This document proposes a solution and a delivery plan for pushing logs-based alerts from OpenShift Logging Loki to Cluster-Monitoring AlertManager. It complements the existing [user-workload monitoring stack][uwm-docs] and [alerting stack][alerting-docs], enabling a full self-service experience for platform and workload logs-based monitoring.

- [1127](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1127): (11/11) general: Proposal for hiding container mountpoints from systemd (lack) ([CNF-5326](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNF-5326))

  > The current implementation of Kubelet and CRI-O both use the top-level
  > namespace for all container and Kubelet mountpoints. However, moving these
  > container-specific mountpoints into a private namespace reduced systemd
  > overhead with no difference in functionality.

- [1131](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1131): (17/17) .github: add a PR template for enhancements (kikisdeliveryservice)

- [1133](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1133): (8/8) general: Guidelines for the use of eBPF in OCP (danwinship)

  > OCP developers and customers alike would like to use eBPF in OCP
  > clusters. At the present time, _some_ eBPF hooks are designed to be
  > "shareable", but others are not (and some are shareable only when used
  > in certain restricted ways). We need to create rules for how OCP will
  > use eBPF and how we expect others to use (or not use it) to prevent
  > conflicts later.

- [1134](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1134): (2/2) installer: installer: adding gcp-ipi-xpn (jstuever)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > This enhancement adds the capability to deploy a GCP cluster into a Shared VPC
  > (XPN) configuration using the Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI)
  > workflow.
