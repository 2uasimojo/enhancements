- [922](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/922): (56/493) installer: Allow installer to include/exclude capabilities based on user selections (bparees)

  > This enhancement proposes a mechanism for cluster installers to exclude one or more optional components
  > (capabilities) for their installation which will determine which payload components are/are not installed
  > in their cluster.  Core components are defined as the set of Second Level Operators managed by the Cluster
  > Version Operator which today cannot be disabled until after completing the install and editing a CVO
  > override, or editing the CVO overrides as part of rendering+editing manifests.  In addition, using CVO
  > overrides put the cluster into an unsupported and un-upgradeable state, making it insufficient as a solution.
  >
  > The proposed UX is to make this a first class part of the install config api with the implementation
  > being arguments supplied to the CVO to filter out the user-selected manifests based on groupings called
  > capabilities.

- [971](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/971): (13/125) insights: Insights Operator pulling and updating pull-secret (transferring uncl… (tremes)

  > This enhancement will enable the Insights Operator to pull the updated `pull-secret` (from the OCM API)
  > and that will enable cluster ownership transfer. Currently, the ownership transfer is a two step process
  > which involves initiating the transfer from the OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM) API
  > and then updating the global `pull-secret` on the cluster with the new owner’s `pull-secret`.
  > If the `pull-secret` is not changed on the cluster within 5 days, the ownership transfer is canceled
  > and needs to be initiated again.
  > This process applies to all scenarios that require cluster ownership transferred across Red Hat accounts.
  >
  > The intent is to simplify the cluster ownership process to a one step process.

- [990](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/990): (55/212) windows-containers: Windows Health Management enhancement (sebsoto)

  > The purpose of this enhancement is to ensure that all Windows nodes managed by the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO)
  > maintain an expected state. With health management implemented, WMCO will automatically ensure that OpenShift related
  > services running on the underlying Windows instances are configured, and have a state inline with the
  > expectations of the installed WMCO version.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 5 Other New pull requests:

- [1002](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1002): (51/51) ingress: CFE-10: Add host-network-bind-options (Elbehery)

  > This enhancement aims to enable reuse of the same nodes by 2 or more Ingress Controllers with `HostNetwork` endpoint strategy without running into port reuse conflicts.
  > This is done by allowing configuration of the ports used by the router pods within the Ingress Controller API specification.

- [1005](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1005): (21/21) update: Synchronized upgrades in DPU clusters (danwinship)

  > In a [cluster with DPUs](../network/dpu/overview.md) (eg, BlueField-2
  > NICs), the x86 hosts form one OCP cluster, and the DPU ARM systems
  > form a second OCP cluster. This makes upgrades to new OCP releases
  > complicated, because there is currently no way to synchronize upgrades
  > between the two clusters, but rebooting the BF-2 systems as part of
  > the MCO upgrade will cause a network outage on the x86 systems. In
  > order for upgrades to work smoothly, we need to synchronize the
  > reboots between the two clusters, so that the BF-2 systems are only
  > rebooted when their corresponding x86 hosts have been cordoned and
  > drained.
  >
  > Please refer to the "Glossary" section of the [DPU Overview
  > Enhancement](../network/dpu/overview.md).

- [1006](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1006): (3/3) storage: WIP - CSI Inline Ephemeral Volume Security (adambkaplan)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > Provide a mechanism where the use of an individual CSI driver capable of
  > provisioning CSI ephemeral volumes (also known as inline ephemeral volumes or
  > inline CSI volumes) can be restricted on pod admission.
