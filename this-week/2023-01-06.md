- [1285](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1285): (17/85) console: Enhancement doc to customize default pre-pinned resources on navigation (debsmita1) ([ODC-5012](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ODC-5012))

  > The Developer perspective on the OpenShift Console provides pinned resources on the navigation which enables the user to go to the resourceâ€™s list page with a single click.
  >
  > Some customers want to provide defaults for those pre-pinned resources for all users.
  >
  > On the Developer perspective navigation, users can see the default pinned resources if they have not customized these pinned resources. Cluster admins have no way to set these default pinned resources for their users. Users can change their pinned resources on their own. The user-pinned resources are saved in the user settings (as-per user-settings ConfigMap).
  >
  > This enhancement allows cluster admins to define pre-pinned resources for new users and users who have not customized their navigation items. Users should still be able to change these defaults and customize the pinned resources on their own. New changes from a cluster admin after a user customize their own pinned resources do not have to be shown.

### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 6 New pull requests:

- [1301](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1301): (48/48) general: Azure Workload Identity (abutcher) ([CCO-187](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CCO-187))

  > Core OpenShift operators (e.g. ingress, image-registry, machine-api) use long-lived credentials to access Azure API services today. This enhancement proposes an implementation by which OpenShift operators would utilize short-lived, [bound service account tokens](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/authentication/bound-service-account-tokens.html) signed by OpenShift that can be
  > trusted by Azure as the `ServiceAccounts` have been associated with [Azure Managed Identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview). [Workload identity federation support for Managed Identities](https://github.com/Azure/azure-workload-identity/issues/325) was recently made public preview by Azure
  > ([announcement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview)) and is the basis for this proposal.

- [1303](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1303): (37/37) ingress: Add gateway-api enhancement (Miciah) ([NE-1105](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-1105))

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > The Ingress Operator is extended to install and manage the Gateway API CRDs and
  > the OpenShift Service Mesh Operator, which manages Istio and Envoy.  This new
  > capability of the Ingress Operator enables a cluster admin to configure
  > Istio/Envoy using Gateway API's GatewayClass and Gateway custom resources and
  > enables project admins to configure Envoy using Gateway API's HTTPRoute custom
  > resource.  (In the future, other Gateway API custom resources will be supported
  > as APIs stabilize and Istio adds support for them.)  The end result is a
  > comprehensive turnkey solution very much like what is possible today using
  > OpenShift's IngressController and Route APIs but with the advantage of using the
  > up-and-coming Kubernetes community standard API for configuring cluster ingress.

- [1304](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1304): (159/159) microshift: USHIFT-599 Make MicroShift core components pluggable (mangelajo) ([USHIFT-599](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-599))

  > This enhancement proposes making some of the core components like CNI and CSI
  > optional and pluggable.
  >
  > In the enhancement proposal we will describe an architecture which would allow
  > customers to install individual components as rpm packages, as well as some
  > alternative implementations.

- [1306](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1306): (68/68) microshift: USHIFT-319: MicroShift greenboot enhancement proposal (ggiguash) ([USHIFT-319](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-319))

  > Assure successful software upgrades and system configuration changes on Edge
  > Devices running MicroShift by using [greenboot](https://github.com/fedora-iot/greenboot),
  > the Generic Health Check Framework for `systemd` on `rpm-ostree` based systems.

- [1307](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1307): (2/2) ingress: Route secret injection for external certificate management (thejasn)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > Currently, users of OpenShift cannot very easily integrate OpenShift Routes
  > with third-party certificate management solutions like [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager).
  > And this is mainly due to the restriction on Routes API requiring the certificate
  > data to be burned in the CR as opposed to having a reference. This is especially
  > problematic when third-party solutions also manage the life cycle (create/renew/delete)
  > of the generated certificates which OpenShift Routes does not support and requires
  > manual intervention to manage certificate life cycle.
  >
  > This enhancement aims to provide a solution where OpenShift Routes can support
  > integration with third-party certificate management solutions like cert-manager and
  > avoid manual certificate management by the user which is more error prone.
