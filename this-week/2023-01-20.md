  `priority/important-soon, jira/valid-reference`

  > This enhancement proposes the addition of supportability tooling to MicroShift.
  >
  > To debug issues in the cluster we need a single command that any user or
  > administrator is able to run to gather all the required information to diagnose
  > and solve problems.

- [1320](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1320): (18/18) microshift: Microshift API server certificate handling (pacevedom) ([USHIFT-716](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-716))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes a strategy to manage API server certificates in all
  > kinds of environments, both externally (accessible through kubeconfig) and
  > internally (pods reaching the API server).
  >
  > MicroShift has a wide variety of different use cases when it comes to API
  > server connectivity, we can find environments where the cluster needs to be
  > reachable with the IP, with the hostname, by some other name having DNS, or
  > a combination of them.

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [1312](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1312): (72/84) microshift: USHIFT-734: MicroShift Upgrade and Rollback (oglok) ([USHIFT-518](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-518))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > Allow successful upgrades of MicroShift running on Edge Devices and enable
  > the ability of going back to a previous working state. To support this process,
  > MicroShift relies on the transactional features of OSTree by atomically
  > switching between states.

- [1242](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1242): (23/162) microshift: ETCD-318: Adding MicroShift etcd enhancement (dusk125) ([ETCD-318](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ETCD-318))

  `tide/merge-method-squash, priority/important-soon`

  > The enhancement proposes moving etcd out of the MicroShift binary and into a transient systemd unit that is launched and managed by MicroShift.

- [1306](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1306): (21/151) microshift: USHIFT-319: Integrating MicroShift with Greenboot enhancement proposal (ggiguash) ([USHIFT-319](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-319))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > Assure successful software upgrades and system configuration changes on Edge
  > Devices running MicroShift by using [greenboot](https://github.com/fedora-iot/greenboot),
  > the Generic Health Check Framework for `systemd` on `rpm-ostree` based systems.

- [1304](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1304): (21/241) microshift: USHIFT-599 Make MicroShift core components pluggable (mangelajo) ([USHIFT-599](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/USHIFT-599))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes making some of the core components like CNI and CSI
  > optional and pluggable.
  >
  > In the enhancement proposal we will describe an architecture which would allow
  > customers to install individual components as rpm packages, as well as some
  > alternative implementations.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Other New pull request:

- [1319](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1319): (2/2) general: Add OpenStack Failure Domains (mdbooth) ([OSASINFRA-2998](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSASINFRA-2998))

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > OpenStack deployments do not have a single implementation of failure domains,
  > but instead define availability zones individually for each service, e.g. Nova
  > (compute), Neutron (network), and Cinder (storage). OpenShift is capable of
  > deploying its control plane across multiple failure domains, but for OpenStack
  > this is currently limited to compute availability zones. This enhancement
  > proposes a unified definition of failure domains for an OpenStack deployment
  > covering all supported availability zone types, and defines how OpenShift will
  > use them when deploying the control plane.
