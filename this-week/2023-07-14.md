### Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 7 Merged pull requests:

- [1291](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1291): (5/198) testing: Improved platform tests (soltysh)

  > /assign @deads2k

- [1389](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1389): (3/14) baremetal: Enable CBO on Azure and GCP platforms (elfosardo) ([METAL-421](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/METAL-421)) ([METAL-435](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/METAL-435))

  > Baremetal Host API is available when deploying an OpenShift cluster with the baremetal platform (via the IPI or AI (Assisted Installer) workflow), with the on-premise platforms Openstack, vSphere, and None, and from the AWS cloud platform.
  > Expanding the possibility to deploy and manage bare metal hosts from clusters in other cloud platforms such as Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) would be beneficial to customers.

- [1410](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1410): (11/55) cluster-logging: LOG-1344: Multi clusterlogforwarder proposal (jcantrill) ([LOG-1344](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1344))

  > Log forwarding is functionally a "cluster singleton" where the operator explicitly only reconcilies a **ClusterLogForwarder** in the  namespace *openshift-logging* named *instance*.  This enhancement removes that restriction to allow administrators to define multiple instance of **ClusterLogForwarder** while retaining the legacy behavior.

- [1414](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1414): (49/66) network: SDN-4004: Admin Network Policy in OVN-K (tssurya) ([SDN-2931](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-2931)) ([SDN-2932](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-2932))

  > This enhancement outlines the design details to implement two new resources which are part
  > of the upstream [NetworkPolicy API](https://network-policy-api.sigs.k8s.io/) effort,
  > `AdminNetworkPolicy` and `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` in OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin. They are
  > [currently in v1alpha1 version](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/network-policy-api/tree/master/apis/v1alpha1)
  > and maintained by Kubernetes `sig-network-policy-api` working group.

- [1419](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1419): (2/36) cluster-logging: Fine grained logs access (aminesnow) ([LOG-4020](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4020))

  > This enhancement proposal seeks to outline the solution for more fine-grained access to LokiStack logs on OpenShift Container Platform 4, ie, have the ability as the cluster administrator to grant access to logs on a namespace basis.
  >
  > The proposal provides an overview of the changes required to achieve this goal as well as some implementation details.

- [1429](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1429): (10/76) console: ODC-7331: New ConsoleSample CRD proposal (jerolimov) ([ODC-7241](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ODC-7241))

  > The Developer Console contains a sample list that helps users initialize workloads and play with features like the "Import from Git" flow.
  >
  > Until 4.13, the [samples-operator](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-samples-operator) and the external Devfile registry ([registry.devfile.io](https://registry.devfile.io/viewer?types=sample)) provide these samples.
  >
  > A `ConsoleSample` CRD will allow other teams, operators, and customers to add additional samples to the console.
