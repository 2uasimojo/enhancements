- [1506](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1506): (109/109) machine-api: [OSD-15261] CPMS: allow automatic vertical scaling. (bergmannf) ([OSD-15261](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSD-15261))

  > To allow control plane nodes to remain at an adequate size for its cluster, this
  > proposal introduces new configuration for the control plane machineset operator
  > to allow it to make automated scaling decisions for control plane node sizing.

- [1508](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1508): (7/7) cluster-logging: LOG-4603: Add log forwarder input selectors for content filtering (jcantrill)

  `do-not-merge/hold, jira/valid-reference`

  > Cluster Logging defines a set of well known log sources in order to facilitate configuration of log collection and normalization.  Given customers are no longer bound to the data storage provided by cluster logging, this enhancement expands those definitions to allow specifying which logs are collected by using Kubernetes metadata.
  >
  >
  > Logs originate from six distinct sources and are logically grouped using the following definitions:
  >
  >
  > * **Application** are container logs from all namespaces across the cluster excluding infrastructure namespaces.
  >
  >
  > * **Infrastructure** logs are:
  >   * container logs from namespaces: default, kube*, openshift*
  >
  >
  > * **Audit** are logs written to files on master nodes that include:
  >   * kubernetes API server
  >   * OpenShift API server
  >   * auditd
  >   * OVN
  >
  >
  > **NOTE**: **application**, **infrastructure**, and **audit** are reserved words to the **cluster-logging-operator** and continue to represent the previous definitions.
  >
  >
  > Administrators use these definitions to specify pipelines to normalize and route messages from the sources to outputs.
  >
  >
  > This enhancement allow administrators to define "named" inputs by expanding the previous definitions as follows:
  >
  >
  > * Named application:
  >   * Any name that is not reserved
  >   * Collect from any namespace including the ones for **infrastructure** container logs
  > * Named infrastructure:
  >   * Any name that is not reserved
  >   * Explicit source choices of: node, container
  > * Named audit:
  >   * Any name that is not reserved
  >   * Explicit source choices of: kubeAPI, openshiftAPI, auditd, ovn

- [1509](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1509): (4/4) network: SDN-4114: initial iptables-deprecation-alerter proposal (danwinship) ([SDN-4114](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-4114))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > IPTables is deprecated in RHEL 9 and will no longer be available in
  > RHEL 10. We need to warn customers who are using iptables in their
  > pods that they will need to migrate to newer APIs by the time OCP
  > moves to RHEL 10 in a few years.

- [1510](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1510): (3/3) installer: OCPSTRAT-736: installer: support AWS Wavelength zones (mtulio) ([OCPSTRAT-736](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPSTRAT-736)) ([SPLAT-1125](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SPLAT-1125)) ([SPLAT-1218](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SPLAT-1218)) ([SPLAT-1219](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SPLAT-1219))

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress, jira/valid-reference`

  > Create support on installer to install an OpenShift cluster on AWS, extending compute nodes to Wavelength as a target infrastructure.
  >
  > [AWS Wavelength highlights](https://aws.amazon.com/wavelength/):
  >
  >   - ***AWS Wavelength embeds AWS compute and storage services within 5G networks, providing mobile edge computing infrastructure for developing, deploying, and scaling ultra-low-latency applications.***
  >
  >   - ***AWS Wavelength is an infrastructure offering optimized for mobile edge computing applications. Wavelength Zones are AWS infrastructure deployments that embed AWS compute and storage services within communications service providersâ€™ (CSP) 5G networks, so application traffic from 5G devices reach application servers running in Wavelength Zones without leaving the telecommunications
  > network. This avoids the latency that would result from application traffic traversing multiple hops across the internet to reach its destination, which allows customers to take full advantage of the latency and bandwidth benefits offered by modern 5G networks.***
  >
  > The enhancement covers the following goals:
  >
  > - Goal 1: Full automation of installing an OpenShift/OKD cluster on AWS extending worker nodes to Wavelength Zone
  > - Goal 2: Installing an OpenShift/OKD cluster on AWS in existing VPC extending worker nodes to Wavelength Zone
  > - Goal 3: Document the steps to extend worker nodes to Wavelength Zones in existing OpenShift/OKD clusters running on AWS
  >
  > The project is divided into the following phases to achieve the full feature:
  >
  > - Phase 1: Installer support to provision required infrastructure components to deploy worker nodes in Wavelength Zones
  > - Phase 2: Machine API support to assign carrier public IP address when creating machines in public subnets on Wavelength Zones
  >
  > The following architecture describes the components used by OpenShift Cluster on AWS with Wavelength Zones, here are the hightlight of new infrastructure components:
  >
  > - Carrier Gateway must be created to allow assigning carrier IP address for components in public subnets.
  > - Public route table with the Carrier Gateway as default route
  > - EC2 instances running OpenShift compute nodes as edge machines: tainted with NoSchedule and custom labels assigned by default.
