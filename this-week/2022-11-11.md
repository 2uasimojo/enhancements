- [1234](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1234): (26/340) cloud-integration: New "External" PlatformType addition proposal (lobziik) ([OCPPLAN-9429](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-9429)) ([OCPPLAN-8156](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-8156))

  > In an effort to reduce the amount of time Red Hat engineers spend directly involved with third party engagements,
  > adding new platforms into the OpenShift product, this enhancement describes how we will add a new `External`
  > platform type that will allow third parties to self-serve and integrate with OpenShift without the need to modify
  > any core payload components and without the need for direct involvement of OpenShift engineers.

### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 New pull requests:

- [1279](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1279): (2/2) insights: WIP on demand Insights data gathering (tremes) ([CCXDEV-8854](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CCXDEV-8854)) ([CCX-195](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CCX-195))

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > The Insights operator periodically gathers cluster data and sends it to Red Hat. The data is analyzed and the corresponding Insights analysis result is provided to the cluster. The OpenShift user can then see the number of active recommendations and go to the Insights advisor for
  > more information. Right now, there is no way for a user to run Insights data gathering on demand - e.g when some of the Insights recommendations have been resolved.

- [1280](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1280): (5/5) monitoring: Proposal for an operator health metric (sradco)

  > This enhancement describes a generic way for operators, that use Prometheus as their monitoring tool, to report the operator health metric based on alerts.
  > This would be the recommended way to report the health metric and will not be enforced.
  >
  > Currently, OLM only reports if the operator csv is in the `succeeded` state, by the `csv_succeeded` metric.
  > This value doesn't "know" if the operator is actually healthy or not.
  > In addition, there is no generic way to create the operators health metric, so it can differ in the way they it is implemented and calculated, which can lead to inconsistencies.

- [1281](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1281): (8/8) network: BGP support for control plane APIs (EmilienM) ([OSASINFRA-2999](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSASINFRA-2999))

  > Many customers deploying OpenShift on top of an on-premise infrastructure which includes bare metal, VMware vSphere,
  > OpenStack and Red Hat RHV have been using the well known bare metal networking stack which includes Keepalived and HAproxy (among other services).
  >
  > While this architecture is now very mature, some customers have higher reliability and scalability needs than before.
  > These customers would like to stretch their cluster across multiple failure domains where the OpenShift control plane
  > would be spread across multiple networks and subnets. For that, the VIPs (for both API and Ingress) would need to be able
  > to sit on multiple L2 domains. This involves that we propose a new architecture, with new tools and options for our customers.
  >
  > This enhancement suggests an alternative that replaces Keepalived and HAproxy by dynamic routing so the control plane VIPs will be highly
  > available and routable.
