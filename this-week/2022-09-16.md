There was 1 Prioritized Merged pull request:

- [1202](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1202): (3/229) storage: STOR-962: Update storage operators for HyperShift (jsafrane) ([STOR-962](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/STOR-962))

  > This enhancement describes how OCP storage components will run in HyperShift's managed control plane and in the guest
  > cluster.
  >
  > The components currently are:
  >
  > * cluster-csi-snapshot-controller-operator and its operand, csi-snapshot-controller.
  > * cluster-storage operator and its operand aws-ebs-csi-driver-operator and its operand AWS EBS CSI driver.
  >   * All other CSI driver operators + CSI drivers should follow the same approach, AWS EBS is just the first one to
  >     run its control plane in HyperShift's management cluster.


### Prioritized New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized New pull request:

- [1239](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1239): (69/69) installer: Installer: Feature Sets (patrickdillon) ([CORS-2253](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CORS-2253))

  `approved, priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes adding support for feature sets to `openshift-install`.
  > Users would be able to enable feature sets at install time. The Installer would support all feature sets in the OpenShift API,
  > and write the selected Feature Set to the cluster.


### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [1237](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1237): (67/92) microshift: Add MicroShift Default CSI Plugin proposal (copejon) ([USHIFT-41](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/USHIFT/issues/USHIFT-41))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes the adoption of a
  > default [Container Storage Interface(CSI) Plugin](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/)for Microshift. For more
  > details on MicroShift, see the respective [proposal](./kubernetes-for-device-edge.md). Kubernetes' CSI implementation
  > provides a standardized model for exposing block and file storage systems to container workloads.

- [918](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/918): (5/252) installer: vsphere: add multiple datacenter and clusters (jcpowermac) ([SPLAT-320](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SPLAT-320))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > The goal of this enhancement is to provide the ability to install in a
  > vSphere environment with multiple datacenters and clusters.
  >
  > This will be an opinionated design, the vCenter datacenter will always be a `region`
  > and a vCenter cluster will always be a `zone`.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Other Merged pull requests:

- [1205](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1205): (12/130) console: Created enhancement doc to customize perspectives (lokanandaprabhu) ([ODC-5897](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ODC-5897))

  > OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) web console provides two perspectives: Administrator and Developer.
  > The Developer perspective provides workflows specific to developer use cases
  > like create, deploy and monitor applications, while Administrator perspective
  > is responsible for managing the cluster resources, users, and projects.
  >
  > This document provides details about how cluster administrator
  > can hide user perspectives.
  >

- [1206](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1206): (20/141) console: Enhancement doc to customize catalogs and sub-catalogs (lokanandaprabhu) ([ODC-6695](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ODC-6695))

  > The OpenShift Console provides a "Developer Catalog" which enables
  > the user to create apps and services based on Operator backed services, helm charts, templates, etc.
  >
  > Cluster administrators can provide additional catalog types
  > via console plugins, for example by installing an operator.
  > These catalog types extend the catalog with additional
  > items and are also available as "sub-catalogs".
  >
  > Some customers want to hide specific types from
  > the catalog or the sub-catalog to streamline their
  > development process without uninstalling a complete operator or disabling the complete console plugin.
  >
  > In the developer catalog the sub-catalogs are shown as types.
  > The developer catalog shows items from all sub-catalogs.
  > When user selects a sub-catalog, they can see a list of
  > available items from this sub-catalog to install.
  >
  > This enhancement allows cluster admins to selectively
  > disable a sub-catalog and all links to the specific sub-catalog.
  > The developer catalog will also hide any of the items from this sub-catalog.
  >
