# This Week in Enhancements - 2022-03-04

*Updates since 2022-02-25*


## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized Merged pull request:

- [1029](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1029): (4/213) network: OVN-Kubernetes on Hypershift (squeed)

  > [Hypershift](https://hypershift-docs.netlify.app/) is a new deployment model for OpenShift which removes the requirement that clusters be "self-hosted". Rather, a given hosted cluster's control plane actually resides as pods on another "management" cluster.
  >
  > Adapting the OVN networking plugin to the Hypershift model requires some careful design. Specifically, OVN provides its own control plane and datastore, all of which will be hosted external to the hosted cluster.
  >
  > Thus, the OpenShift OVN deployment model must be updated to support split control planes. Likewise, the Network Operator must be able to manage components on both the control plane as well as the hosted cluster.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Other Merged pull requests:

- [952](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/952): (11/53) ingress: NE-585 Expose HealthCheck Interval (candita)

  > Expose and make configurable the `ROUTER_BACKEND_CHECK_INTERVAL` environment variable in HAProxy's template so that
  > administrators may customize the length of time between consecutive healthchecks of backend services.
  >
  > This is already configurable via a route annotation called `router.openshift.io/haproxy.health.check.interval`, but
  > exposing the healthcheck interval at a global scope is desired for efficient administration of routes.  HAProxy allows
  > setting the healthcheck globally as well as per-route, and both options will be addressed as a part of this proposal.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Other New pull requests:

- [1047](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1047): (3/3) authentication: AUTH-125 Cert Manager enhancement document (slaskawi)

  > This enhancement outlines the implementation details of a Cert Manager support
  > for OpenShift.
  >
  > The key things to highlight are:
  > - This feature will be provided as an OLM-based Operator
  > - The Operator implementation will be based on `library-go`
  > - The productization pipeline will be used for the release process

- [1048](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1048): (13/13) network: Dual Stack VIPs for on-prem deployments (cybertron)

  > Originally the on-prem loadbalancer architecture supported only single-stack
  > ipv4 or ipv6 deployments. When dual stack support was added for the baremetal
  > platform, we carried over the VIP configuration that only allowed for a single
  > VIP to be specified. The thinking was that in dual stack clusters every node
  > would have access to either ipv4 or ipv6 endpoints. While this is true of the
  > nodes, it is not necessarily true of the applications that run in the cluster
  > and may need to interact with the API or ingress services.
  >
  > This design is proposing the addition of a second VIP for dual stack clusters
  > so API and ingress are accessible from either ip version.
