## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized Active pull request:

- [593](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/593): (2/142) general: Add proposal for hiding container mountpoints from systemd (lack)

  `lifecycle/rotten, priority/important-soon`

  > The current implementation of Kubelet and CRI-O both use the top-level
  > namespace for all container and Kubelet mountpoints. However, moving these
  > container-specific mountpoints into a private namespace reduced systemd
  > overhead with no difference in functionality.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 14 Other Merged pull requests:

- [1008](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1008): (36/294) machine-api: [OCPCLOUD-1248] Add initial iteration of ControlPlaneMachineSet operator enhancement (JoelSpeed)

  > To enable automated management of vertical scaling and replacement of Control Plane Machines, this proposal introduces
  > a new resource and controller that will manage Control Plane Machine instances.

- [1010](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1010): (6/92) authentication: add enhancement on PSa autolabeling (stlaz) ([AUTH-133](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AUTH-133))

  > This enhancement expands the "PodSecurity admission in OpenShift". It introduces
  > an opt-in mechanism that allows users to to keep their workloads running when
  > Pod Security Admission plugin gets turned on.

- [1059](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1059): (6/280) baremetal: Converge ZTP and Metal3 flows (dtantsur) ([METAL-10](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/METAL-10)) ([METAL-192](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/METAL-192))

  > This enhancement proposes converging two somewhat different bare-metal
  > provisioning flows in OpenShift:
  >
  > - *Standard* Metal3 flow used in bare-metal IPI and [baremetal-operator][bmo]
  >   (BMO). Uses the [Ironic agent][ipa] (also known as ironic-python-agent or
  >   simply IPA) for writing the CoreOS image.
  >
  > - ZTP (Zero-Touch Provisioning) flow using the so-called *live ISO* Ironic and
  >   baremetal-operator feature, the assisted service and the assisted agent.

- [1084](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1084): (6/27) ingress: enhancement/ingress: add max connections tuning (frobware) ([NE-577](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-577))

  > Enable cluster administrators to tune the maximum number of simultaneous
  > connections for OpenShift router deployments.
  >
  > OpenShift router currently hard-codes the maximum number of
  > simultaneous connections that HAProxy can handle to 20000, and it has
  > done so for all OpenShift v4 releases up to and including 4.10. It
  > should be possible for administrators to tune this value based on the
  > capability and sizing of their infrastructure nodes. Increasing the
  > maximum number of simultaneous connections will improve router
  > throughput at the expense of increased memory usage. Equally,
  > decreasing the current value may be of interest for Single Node
  > OpenShift (SNO) deployments. This proposal extends the existing
  > IngressController API to add a tuning option for max connections.

There were 2 Other New pull requests:

- [1114](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1114): (52/52) ingress: Add option to manage DNS to ingresscontrollers (thejasn) ([CFEPLAN-58](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CFEPLAN-58))

  `tide/merge-method-squash`

  > The ingress operator currently assumes that it's going to create and
  > manage DNS using the required cloud provider integration. But in some
  > circumstances, the required DNS zone may be different from the cluster
  > DNS zone and may not even be hosted in the cloud provider. In such scenarios,
  > the operator reports a degraded state after provisioning the required
  > resources in the cloud provider because the provided DNS can't be created.
  >
  > This enhancement aims to provide the end-user the ability to completely disable
  > DNS management on an Ingress Controller.
