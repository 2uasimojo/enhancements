# This Week in Enhancements - 2021-04-23

I manually added the `priority/important-soon` label to a few pull
requests this week, but may not have caught all of them. If you are
the author or reviewer of a pull request that is related to a 4.9
release priority, please make use the `/priority important-soon`
command on the PR to label it so the newsletter tool sorts it into the
right section.

## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized New Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized New Enhancement:

- [744](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/744): (3/3) general: External control plane topology (csrwng)

  > External control plane support was introduced in OCP 4 with the support
  > for the [IBM Cloud Managed service](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/update/ibm-public-cloud-support.md) (ROKS). At the time, this was the only platform that
  > was run with an external control plane. It was sufficient to use a platform type of
  > `IBMCloud` to distinguish it from other OCP installations with traditional
  > control plane topology.
  >
  > More recently, an orthogonal field was [added to the Infrastructure resource](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/single-node/cluster-high-availability-mode-api.md) to indicate
  > the type of control plane topology. Current supported values for the `controlPlaneTopology` field
  > are `HighlyAvailable` and `SingleReplica`.
  >
  > This enhancement proposes adding a third possible value to the control plane topology
  > field: `External`. A value of `External` in this field indicates that control plane components
  > such as Kube API server, Kube Controller Manager, and Kube Scheduler are running outside
  > the cluster and are not visible as pods inside the cluster.

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Other Merged pull requests:

- [551](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/551): (5/57) machine-api: Propose to backport the "external remediation template" feature (slintes)

  > By using `MachineHealthChecks` a cluster admin can configure automatic remediation of unhealthy machines and nodes.
  > The machine healthcheck controller's remediation strategy is deleting the machine, and letting the cloud provider
  > create a new one. This isn't the best remediation strategy in all environments.
  >
  > There is already a mechanism to provide an alternative, external remediation strategy, by adding an annotation to the
  > `MachineHealthCheck` and then to `Machine`s. However, this is isn't very maintainable and diverges from upstream.
  >
  > With this enhancement we propose a better, future-proof mechanism, that aligns us with the mechanism implemented upstream.
  > This proposal is a backport of parts of the upstream machine healthcheck proposal [0], which
  > also is already implemented [1].
  >
  > - [0] [upstream machine healthcheck proposal](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/master/docs/proposals/20191030-machine-health-checking.md)
  > - [1] [upstream machine healthcheck implementation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/3606)

#### Other Merged Updates

- [739](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/739): (9/9) general: management-workload-partitioning: improve namespacing in annotation names (dhellmann)

### Other New Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 9 Other New pull requests:

- [736](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/736): (5/5) installer: Add enhancement - PowerVS IPI provider (jaypoulz)

  > This document describes how [PowerVS][powervs-website] becomes an infra provider for OpenShift. PowerVS is a cloud offering by IBM that aims to provid customers interested in running secure and flexible workloads on IBM Power (ppc64le) hardware without having to develop and maintain an on premise datacenter. The goal of this enhancement would be to leverage the PowerVS APIs to deploy an
  > OpenShift cluster on this cloud environment. In addition, the APIs would be leveraged for cluster resizing operations post installation.

- [737](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/737): (1/1) update: enhancements/update/targeted-update-edge-blocking: Client-side platform parameter (wking)

  > This enhancement proposes a mechanism for blocking edges for the
  > subset of clusters considered vulnerable to known issues with a
  > particular update or target release.
  >
  > I still prefer the flexibility of a PromQL approach (#426).  But that is a bigger update-service shift, and I haven't been able to convince folks it's worth doing, and maybe they're right and it is overkill.  This alternative proposal guesses that "platform" will help with targeting most of our target-able blockers, and be quicker to implement.  Historically, it would have been helpful in
  > scoping down:
  >
  > * [rhbz#1809296](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1809296) in 4.3, affecting GCP clusters.
  > * [rhbz#1858026](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1858026#c21) in 4.5, affecting born-in-4.1 `None` clusters.
  > * [rhbz#1904582](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1904582#c4) in 4.6, affecting born-in-4.1 AWS clusters.
  > * [rhbz#1935539](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1935539#c21) and [rhbz#1942207](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1942207#c3) in 4.7, affecting vSphere clusters.

- [738](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/738): (79/79) network: Installing OCP on ARM-Based Smart NICs (danwinship)

  > As servers have greater and greater networking needs, hardware vendors
  > have created increasingly more complex and powerful network cards. The
  > latest iteration of this is "Smart NICs" that include an entire ARM
  > system running Linux on the NIC. With such a NIC, we can offload
  > nearly all network processing from the host computer onto the NIC
  > "DPU" (Data Processing Unit), freeing up host CPU resources for
  > customer workloads (and allowing faster data transfer by ensuring the
  > network stack doesn't need to compete for CPU with the customer
  > workload).
  >
  > However, doing this requires installing and managing an appropriate
  > software stack on all of the NICs in the cluster. This software will
  > need to be kept in sync with the software on the host PC (eg, as new
  > functionality is added to OCP). The obvious answer to this problem is
  > to run OpenShift on the NIC as well as on the host.
  >
  > The initial target of this work is the [NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU].
  > However, similar products are being worked on by other vendors which
  > we will eventually want to support, so the solution should not be too
  > specialized to this one product.
  >
  > [NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU]: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/data-processing-unit/

- [742](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/742): (38/38) cluster-scope-secret-volumes: Update projected resource CSI driver proposal (adambkaplan)

  > This proposal will describe a [CSI driver](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) based means for OpenShift cluster administrators to share `Secrets` / `ConfigMaps` defined in one namespace with other namespaces.
  >
  > Any owners/authors/users of Pods in those namespaces can opt into the consumption of the content of those shared `Secrets` / `ConfigMaps` during their Pod's execution.

- [745](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/745): (65/65) security: Security Profiles Operator integration in OpenShift (JAORMX)

  > Let's integrate the [Security Profiles Operator](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/security-profiles-operator)
  > as part of the OpenShift platform in order to allow folks to:
  >
  > * Easily install security profiles to secure their workloads
  >   (both SELinux and Seccomp)
  >
  > * Manage the lifecycle of the aforementioned profiles (make sure
  >   that they get attached to the appropriate container as upgrades
  >   happen)
  >
  > * Enable users to automatically generate profiles for their workloads
  >
  > * Provide predefined profiles for existing default workloads in OpenShift

- [746](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/746): (2/2) update: Add RFE for unordered OCP versions label (bentito)

  > As part of an Operator's bundle definition it may specify the OpenShift version, or versions, it supports. The label, `com.redhat.openshift.versions` allows for this specification. Currently, this may be enforced at several points in the build pipeline (pyxis, IIB). This enhancement seeks to specify that bundle authors may list versions v4.5 or v4.6 in either order if providing a list of
  > supported
  > OpenShift versions. This enhancement also seeks to sunset this behavior, by only allowing these two specific versions as a list. Going forward, authors would specify a single version, or range, of OpenShift the bundle is supported on. There would no longer be a comma separated list allowed.

- [747](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/747): (12/12) network: Add Kubernetes nmstate operator to CVO (yboaron)

  > Add the Kubernetes NMState Operator to CVO.
  >
  > Currently, there are multiple methods of installing Kubernetes NMState into a cluster:
  >
  > - CNV uses a [custom operator - CNAO](https://github.com/kubevirt/cluster-network-addons-operator#nmstate) that installs Kubernetes NMstate, among other network related items.
  > The CNAO is deployed using [Hyperconverged Cluster Operator - HCO](https://github.com/kubevirt/hyperconverged-cluster-operator).
  > To deploy Kubernetes NMstate it needs to deploy HCO --> CNAO --> Kubernetes NMstate
  > - A [new operator](https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes-nmstate/blob/master/manifests/kubernetes-nmstate-operator.package.yaml) has been developed specifically to install Kubernetes NMstate using OLM.
  >
  > It is desirable for this to converge.
  >
  > Adding the Kubernetes NMstate as part of the CVO will allow for convenient and non-cumbersome use, which will also allow for uniformity between the various platforms (CNV, IPI-Baremetal).

- [748](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/748): (4/4) cluster-logging: New proposal: Forwarder output parameter templates (alanconway)

  > The ClusterLogForwarder.Outputs API can already set some output parameters from log record fields.
  >
  > This proposal allows multiple record fields to be _combined_ into an output value.

- [749](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/749): (10/10) ingress: NE-310 Enhancement proposal for HSTS route admission plugin (candita)

  > In 3.x and 4.x customers can [provide a per-route annotation to
  > enable
  > HSTS](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/networking/routes/route-configuration.html#nw-enabling-hsts_route-configuration). For
  > customers with many routes or regulatory compliance issues, the
  > manual per-route annotation is seen as sub-optimal.
  >
  > This enhancement extends the `Ingress.config.openshift.io` API and
  > adds a new `route` admission controller to the OpenShift API
  > server which together allow cluster administrators to enforce HSTS
  > globally. This enhancement also provides a recommendation for
  > batch route annotation configuration.
