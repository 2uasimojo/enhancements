### Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 6 Merged pull requests:

- [736](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/736): (10/248) installer: Add enhancement - IBM Cloud provider for Power Virtual Server platform (jaypoulz)

  > This document describes how the [IBM Cloud][ibm-cloud-website] can be leveraged to provide infrastructure to deploy
  > OpenShift on the [Power Virtual Server][power-vs-website] offering. Power Virtual Server, or Power VS, is an IBM Cloud
  > offering that aims to provide customers interested in running secure and flexible workloads on IBM Power (ppc64le)
  > hardware without having to develop and maintain on-premise datacenters. The goal of this enhancement would be to
  > leverage the IBM Cloud APIs to deploy an OpenShift cluster on this cloud instance hardware. In addition, the APIs would
  > be leveraged for cluster resizing operations post-installation.

- [913](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/913): (10/157) machine-api: Add cluster-api integration enhancement (alexander-demichev)

  > This enhancement describes the process of integrating the upstream [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api)
  > project into OpenShift standalone clusters.

- [989](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/989): (13/160) machine-api: [OCPCLOUD-1373] Add AWS EFA Networking enhancement (JoelSpeed)

  > AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a feature within EC2 that allows for network adapters that provide high throughput
  > for HPC applications communicating via MPI to be attached to certain instance types. With the presence of these network
  > adapters and some additional drivers, workloads can take advantage of greatly improved network performance between
  > nodes within the same AWS availability zone.

### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 5 New pull requests:

- [1008](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1008): (76/76) machine-api: [OCPCLOUD-1248] Add initial iteration of ControlPlaneSet operator enhancement (JoelSpeed)

  > To enable automated management of vertical scaling and replacement of Control Plane Machines, this proposal introduces
  > a new resource and controller that will manage Control Plane Machine instances.

- [1009](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1009): (2/2) general: OpenStack Cloud Provider Config Upgrade (stephenfin)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > In 4.11, we wish to switch OpenStack clusters from the legacy cloud provider to
  > the external Cloud Controller Manager (CCM). The legacy cloud provider
  > configuration is in a user-managed ConfigMap in the openshift-config namespace.
  > The configuration for the two cloud providers are similar but not identical.
  > This enhancement will describe how we can ensure correct configuration is passed
  > to the cloud provider in use.

- [1010](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1010): (2/2) authentication: add enhancement on PSa autolabeling (stlaz)

  > This enhancement expands the "PodSecurity admission in OpenShift". It introduces
  > an opt-in mechanism that allows users to to keep their workloads running when
  > Pod Security Admission plugin gets turned on.

- [1013](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1013): (4/4) cluster-logging: LOG-1043 Flow control API enhancements. (alanconway)

  > If the log collector cannot keep up with the rate that logs are written, some logging data will be lost.
  > Lack of  flow control these problems:
  > * Hard to predict and impossible to control the volume of logs.
  > * No control over which logs get lost.
  > * During an outage, log buffers build up without user control.
  >   This can cause long recovery times and very high latency when the connection is restored.
  >
  > This proposal defines an API to let cluster administrators to limit logging rates, or ignore some logs entirely.
  > Logs may still be lost if the collector cannot keep up, but administrators have more control over *what* is lost,
  > and more predictability of log rates.

- [1014](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1014): (14/14) multi-arch: Heterogenous architecture clusters (Prashanth684)

  > This enhancement describes the [plan][OCPPLAN-4577] to support provisioning and upgrades of heterogenous architecture clusters. A heterogenous cluster is a cluster with nodes running on different architectures. The node pools within
  > the cluster are homogenous. The cluster would be one with a homogenous control plane with worker node pools, supporting any combination of architectures (eg: x86 control plane + ARM worker nodes). This document
  > describes the support needed for heterogenous architecture clusters in phases. There will be three major phases with basic support through phase 1 which is targeted for 4.11 and other features are targeted beyond release 4.11.
  > The targeted platforms in the initial phases are mainly AWS and Azure with support for disconnected installs as well. The architectures that will be supported and can be used in these initial phases are x86 and ARM. Support
  > for other architectures will be included beyond the 4.11 time frame.
