### Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 5 Merged pull requests:

- [1395](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1395): (9/85) security: Support BMC CA Certificate (zhouhao3) ([RFE-3505](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RFE-3505))

  > This enhancement allows users to provide local CA certificates for IPI
  > installation or subsequent node management, ensuring secure communication
  > with baremetal BMCs that use certificates issued by the local CA or use
  > self-signed certificates.

- [1409](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1409): (17/42) network: Upgrading to 4.14 with OVN IC (ricky-rav) ([SDN-3905](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-3905))

  > Allow any upgrade path that proceeds via a 4.13 self-hosted or hypershift-hosted cluster to smoothly upgrade to 4.14, which features OVNK InterConnect (IC) multizone.

- [1447](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1447): (6/15) etcd: ETCD-425: adding etcd tuning profiles enhancement (dusk125) ([ETCD-425](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ETCD-425))

  > This enhancement would replace the hardcoded values for the etcd parameters HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL and LEADER_ELECTION_TIMEOUT with predefined "profiles".
  > Each profile would map to predefined, and pretested, values for the internal etcd parameters.
  > This would allow for some user tweaking without giving them access to the full range of values.
  > This enhancement only covers the mvp for a tech preview release of this new feature; a future enhancement will be necessary.
