## Enhancements

### Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Merged pull requests:

- [1421](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1421): (3/162) general: Shared and Guaranteed CPU Pools (bartwensley) ([CNF-8759](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNF-8759))

  > This enhancement describes an approach to split the single CPU pool currently used by kubernetes into two
  > partitions (shared and guaranteed). The guaranteed partition will be used exclusively for containers with
  > the guaranteed QoS that consume whole CPUs. This will allow special kernel configuration to be applied to
  > this set of CPUs, to enable low latency applications (e.g. 5G RAN vDU), without affecting other applications
  > running on the same server.

- [1486](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1486): (6/9) etcd: Automated Backups of Etcd (hasbro17) ([ETCD-81](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ETCD-81))

  > Enable the automated backups of etcd snapshots and other metadata necessary to restore an OpenShift self-hosted cluster from a quorum loss scenario.

### New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 New pull requests:

- [1496](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1496): (43/43) machine-config: Managing boot images via the MCO (djoshy) ([MCO-589](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MCO-589))

  `approved`

  > This is a proposal to manage bootimages via the `Machine Config Operator`(MCO), leveraging some of the [pre-work](https://github.com/openshift/installer/pull/4760) done as a result of the discussion in [#201](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/201). This feature will only target standalone OCP installs. It will also be user opt-in and is planned to be released behind a feature
  > gate.
  >
  > For Installer Provisioned Infrastructure(IPI) clusters, the end goal is to create a mechanism that can:
  > - update the boot images references in `MachineSets` to the latest in the payload image
  > - ensure stub ignition referenced in each `Machinesets` is in spec 3 format
  >
  > For User Provisioned Infrastructure(UPI) clusters, this end goal is to create a document(KB or otherwise) that a cluster admin would follow to update their boot images.

- [1497](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1497): (14/14) cluster-logging: LOG-4606: Initial proposal for Azure Monitor Log integration (vparfonov)

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > [Azure Monitor: Log Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial)
  > Azure Monitor Logs is a comprehensive service provided by Microsoft Azure that enables the collection, analysis, and
  > actioning of telemetry data across various Azure and on-premises resources. It facilitates advanced analytics,
  > offering profound insights into the performance and health of applications and workloads running on Azure.
  > This proposal extends the `ClusterLogForwarder` API with an output type for Azure Monitor Logs.
