# This Week in Enhancements - 2021-11-12

## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [862](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/862): (15/150) machine-api: Add Machine Deletion Hooks Proposal (JoelSpeed)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > Defines a set of lifecycle hookos that can be applied to a Machine which can be used
  > to delay the actions taken by the Machine controller once a Machine has been marked
  > for deletion. These hooks are optional and may be applied during Machine
  > creation, sometime after Machine creation by a user, or sometime after Machine
  > creation by another controller or application, up until the Machine has been marked
  > for deletion.

- [867](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/867): (4/170) node-tuning: Move PAO to OCP enhancement (MarSik)

  `priority/important-soon`

  > The [Performance Addon Operator](https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators) is a component that makes it easier to configure an OCP cluster for low latency and real-time purposes [OCP docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/scalability_and_performance/cnf-performance-addon-operator-for-low-latency-nodes.html).
  > It is a high level orchestrator that consumes a [Performance Profile](https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators/blob/master/docs/interactions/performance-profile.yaml) and generates multiple manifests that are then processed by core OpenShift components like MCO and NTO.
  >
  > The proposal in hand is to move the existing implementation of PAO under
  > [cluster node tuning operator (NTO)](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-node-tuning-operator) without adding new features.

## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 6 Other Merged pull requests:

- [475](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/475): (13/49) general: enhancements/update/update-blocker-lifecycle: Propose a new enhancement (wking)

  > Currently all tracking through the lifecycle is manual, and it is tedious for graph-admins to audit bugs with `UpgradeBlocker` to see where they are in the lifecycle and, when necessary, poke component teams about outstanding impact statement requests.
  > Having an explicit, machine-readable lifecycle reduces the chances that suspected update blockers fall through the cracks by clarifying the responsible parties for moving the bug to the next stage, which supports tracking and automated reminders.

- [732](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/732): (11/218) general: Add Smart NIC OVN offload enhancement (zshi-redhat)

  > See [DPU Support in OCP (Overview)](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/738). This document describes the
  > OCP modification in Tenant cluster in details.

- [836](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/836): (7/28) etcd: ETCD-58: Add enhancement for automated defragmentation (hexfusion)

  > Enable automated defragmentation of the etcd cluster state.

- [890](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/890): (2/65) general: Introduce DPU Network Operator (pliurh)

  > To facilitate the management of Nvidia BlueField-2 DPU, a two-cluster design is being
  > proposed. Under such design, a BlueField-2 card will be provisioned as a worker
  > node of the ARM-based infra cluster, whereas the tenant cluster where the normal
  > user applications run on, is composed of the X86 servers.
  >
  > The OVN-Kubernetes components are spread over the two clusters. On the tenant
  > cluster side, the Cluster Network Operator is in charge of the management of the
  > ovn-kube components. On the infra cluster side, we propose to create a new
  > operator to be responsible for the life-cycle management of the ovn-kube components
  > and the necessary host network initialization on DPU cards.

- [894](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/894): (89/172) authentication: authentication/login-logout: initial enhancement (s-urbaniak)

  > This enhancement describes capturing login, login failure, and logout events in the OpenShift authentication subsystems.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Other New pull requests:

- [952](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/952): (2/2) ingress: NE-585 Expose HealthCheck Interval (candita)

  > Expose and make configurable the ROUTER_BACKEND_CHECK_INTERVAL environment variable in HAProxy's template so that
  > administrators may customize the length of time between subsequent healthchecks of backend services.
  >
  > This is already configurable via a route annotation called `router.openshift.io/haproxy.health.check.interval`, but
  > exposing the healthcheck interval at a global scope is desired for efficient administration of routes.  HAProxy allows
  > setting the healthcheck globally as well as per-route, and both options will be addressed as a part of this proposal.

- [955](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/955): (36/36) authentication: Enhancement for OAuth2 Authorization Grant Login for oc (arjunrn)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > The current CLI login process involves multiple interactive steps where the user has to enter credentials multiple
  > times. This process can be simplified so that the `oc` tool can be used to login directly without having to first login
  > to the cluster console, the OAuth server and finally copying the login command. The `oc` tool can be modified to act as
  > a public client to the Openshift OAuth server and received an access token
  > through [Authorization Grant](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3) flow
  > and [PKCE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636).
