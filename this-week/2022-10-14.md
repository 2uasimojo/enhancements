- [1257](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1257): (2/2) general: Priority Classes enhancement preliminary doc (WIP) (a-dsouza) ([1041](https://github.com/openshift/hypershift/issues/1041))

  > This proposal details the plan for enabling the HyperShift Operator to adjust the priority class of master control plane components to be higher if the customer is using more worker nodes in their cluster.

- [1260](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1260): (5/5) installer: installer-aws: Cluster deployment on AWS Outpost (pkliczewski) ([OCPPLAN-9617](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-9617)) ([ECOPROJECT-866](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ECOPROJECT-866))

  > Running workload closer to end users or leveraging data locality seems to be
  > important for many customers. That is why AWS came up with fully [managed
  > service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/how-outposts-works.html)
  > that extends AWS infrastructure and run on customer's premises. This enhancement
  > proposes extending how we deploy OCP on AWS platform so it ispossible to run on
  > AWS Outpost.
  >
  > The work is divided into several phases:
  > - Phase 0: Research. Understand what is needed to deploy OCP on AWS Outpost.
  >   No code changes needed and we only provide documentation on how to customize
  >   generated manifests and list known limitations.
  > - Phase 1: Improve cluster deployment on AWS Ouptost by implementing necessary
  >   changes and provide mitigations to know limitations.
  > - Phase 2: Add OCP on AWS Outpost support to ROSA for regular clusters and HyperShift.

  > This enhancement proposes the adoption of a
  > default [Container Storage Interface(CSI) Plugin](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/)for Microshift. For more
  > details on MicroShift, see the respective [proposal](./kubernetes-for-device-edge.md). Kubernetes' CSI implementation
  > provides a standardized model for exposing block and file storage systems to container workloads.
