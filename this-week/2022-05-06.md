## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized Merged pull request:

- [1067](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1067): (42/405) agent-installer: Automated Workflow for Agent-based Installer (dhellmann) ([AGENT-10](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AGENT-10))

  > "Cluster 0" deployments, for the first cluster in an environment, are
  > unique because they occur in situations where there may not be a lot
  > of other infrastructure to support long-running services normally
  > associated with automated provisioning for on-premises use
  > cases. Nevertheless, users and partners want to automate these
  > deployments. The assisted installer GUI provides an excellent user
  > experience for deploying connected clusters. This enhancement covers
  > the *user-provided automation* use case for disconnected clusters.

There were 9 Other New pull requests:

- [1104](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1104): (2/2) olm: enhancements/olm: Recursive ClusterOperators (wking)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > This enhancement proposes using ClusterOperator all over the place, not just for passing information up to the [cluster-version operator (CVO)][cluster-version-operator].

- [1106](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1106): (10/10) storage: OpenStack Cinder CSI Driver Operator Configurability (stephenfin) ([OSASINFRA-2857](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSASINFRA-2857))

  > The OpenStack Cinder CSI Driver Operator is responsible for deploying and
  > configuring the Cinder CSI Driver. Currently, there is no way for an end user
  > to configure this. This is a regression from the in-tree cinder block storage
  > driver, which could be configured using the user-managed config map
  > `cloud-provider-config` in `openshift-config` (note: the configuration for the
  > legacy and external block storage services are similar, but not identical). In
  > 4.11 we want to switch OpenStack clusters from the legacy cloud provider to the
  > external Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) and will need to switch completely to
  > the Cinder CSI driver as a result.
  >
  > This enhancement will describe how we can ensure an end user can configure the
  > Cinder CSI driver using the same user-managed config map they would have used
  > for the legacy block storage service.
