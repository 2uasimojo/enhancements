- [753](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/753): (4/4) workload-partitioning: add plan for configuration and enablement ownership (dhellmann)

  > The initial iteration of workload partitioning focused on a short path
  > to a minimum viable implementation. This enhancement describes the
  > loose ends for preparing the feature for GA at a high level, and
  > explains the set of other design documents that need to be written
  > separately during the next iteration.

- [759](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/759): (2/2) 100	enhancements: workload-partitioning: reorganize (dhellmann)

### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [744](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/744): (50/52) general: External control plane topology (csrwng)

  > External control plane support was introduced in OCP 4 with the support
  > for the [IBM Cloud Managed service](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/update/ibm-public-cloud-support.md) (ROKS). At the time, this was the only platform that
  > was run with an external control plane. It was sufficient to use a platform type of
  > `IBMCloud` to distinguish it from other OCP installations with traditional
  > control plane topology.
  >
  > More recently, an orthogonal field was [added to the Infrastructure resource](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/single-node/cluster-high-availability-mode-api.md) to indicate
  > the type of control plane topology. Current supported values for the `controlPlaneTopology` field
  > are `HighlyAvailable` and `SingleReplica`.
  >
  > This enhancement proposes adding a third possible value to the control plane topology
  > field: `External`. A value of `External` in this field indicates that control plane components
  > such as Etcd, Kube API server, Kube Controller Manager, and Kube Scheduler are running outside
  > the cluster and are not visible as pods inside the cluster.

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Other Merged pull requests:

- [635](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/635): (1/57) manifestlist: IR-57: API changes for manifest list support (ricardomaraschini)

  > A manifest list is a group of image manifests, it is used to keep track of references to images
  > targeting different platforms/architectures in a single entity. OpenShift does not support this
  > type of manifest, it currently supports only a 1 to 1 mapping (one manifest pointing to one
  > image).
  >
  > This enhancement proposal designs a plan to add support for this new type of manifest in
  > OpenShift.

- [637](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/637): (10/278) monitoring: Add: Alerting Standards (michaelgugino)

  > Clear and actionable alerts are a key component of a smooth operational
  > experience.  Ensuring we have clear and concise guidelines for our alerts
  > will allow developers to better inform users of problem situations and how to
  > resolve them.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 5 Other New pull requests:

- [751](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/751): (50/50) builds: WIP - Disable Jenkins Pipeline Build Strategy (adambkaplan)

  > OpenShift 3.0 included a way to invoke a Jenkins pipeline from an OpenShift build.
  > The status of the build on the OpenShift cluster would reflect the state of the pipeline in Jenkins.
  > This was the first feature to support continuous integration/delivery processes on OpenShift.
  >
  > As OpenShift and Kubernetes have evolved, so has cloud-native CI/CD.
  > Tekton and its downstream distribution - OpenShift Pipelines - provide a way of running CI/CD processes natively on Kubernetes.
  > The Jenkins pipeline strategy was officially deprecated in OpenShift 4.1, but at that time there was no meaningful replacement.
  > We now have that meaningful replacement with the general availability of OpenShift Pipelines.
  > It is time to disable OpenShift's direct integration with Jenkins.

- [758](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/758): (20/20) security: Security Context Constraints for CSI Volumes (adambkaplan)

  > Ephemeral CSI volumes are a newer type of volume in Kubernetes, which allows content to mounted into pods with underlying ephemeral file systems.
  > OpenShift Security Context Constraints (SCCs) take an all-or-nothing approach when it comes to these volumes.
  > A service account/user can either mount a `csi` volume, or it cannot.
  > This proposal will enhance SCCs to control which CSI drivers are allowed.
