# This Week in Enhancements - 2021-12-03

## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Prioritized Merged pull requests:

- [862](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/862): (8/173) machine-api: Add Machine Deletion Hooks Proposal (JoelSpeed)

  > Defines a set of lifecycle hooks that can be applied to a Machine which can be used
  > to delay the actions taken by the Machine controller once a Machine has been marked
  > for deletion. These hooks are optional and may be applied during Machine
  > creation, sometime after Machine creation by a user, or sometime after Machine
  > creation by another controller or application, up until the Machine has been marked
  > for deletion.

- [867](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/867): (2/183) node-tuning: Move PAO to OCP enhancement (MarSik)

  > The [Performance Addon Operator](https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators) is a component that makes it easier to configure an OCP cluster for low latency and real-time purposes [OCP docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/scalability_and_performance/cnf-performance-addon-operator-for-low-latency-nodes.html).
  > It is a high level orchestrator that consumes a [Performance Profile](https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators/blob/master/docs/interactions/performance-profile.yaml) and generates multiple manifests that are then processed by core OpenShift components like MCO and NTO.
  > We have a simplified interaction diagram here: https://github.com/openshift-kni/performance-addon-operators/blob/master/docs/interactions/diagram.png
  > A more in depth description of how a low latency tuned cluster works was presented at DevConf 2021: https://devconfcz2021.sched.com/event/gmJD/openshift-for-low-latency-and-real-time-workloads
  >
  > The proposal in hand is to move the existing implementation of PAO under
  > [cluster node tuning operator (NTO)](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-node-tuning-operator) without adding new features.

- [902](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/902): (11/19) kubelet: Add swap support to OpenShift (ehashman)

  > The upstream Kubernetes 1.22 release introduced alpha support for configuring
  > swap memory usage for Kubernetes workloads on a per-node basis.
  >
  > Now that swap use on nodes is supported in upstream, there are a number of use
  > cases that would benefit from OpenShift nodes supporting swap, including
  > improved node stability, better support for applications with high memory
  > overhead but smaller working sets, the use of memory-constrained devices, and
  > memory flexibility.

## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 7 Other Merged pull requests:

- [876](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/876): (10/91) ingress: Add mutable-publishing-scope enhancement (Miciah)

  > This enhancement defines an approach for allowing users to modify the scope of a
  > service load-balancer for an IngressController that uses the LoadBalancerService
  > endpoint publishing strategy type.

- [939](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/939): (16/167) machine-config: [OCPNODE-725] Control Group v2 Enablement on New Clusters (rphillips)

  > Control Group v2 (cgroup v2) enablement in Kubernetes has progressed to beta
  > [upstream](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2254-cgroup-v2).
  > The underlying runtime (cri-o) and supporting subsystems are now ready for
  > customers to begin their own testing with it. Not all workloads will be
  > compatible with cgroup v2, so it will *not* be enabled by default within
  > OpenShift at this time.
  >
  > Note: This enhancement is focusing on `pure` mode cgroup v2. Mixed mode environments
  > may behave differently (metrics, vpa, hpa, etc) since cgroup v1 is not
  > compatible with cgroup v2.

- [963](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/963): (40/40) network: Proposal to allow MTU changes with rolling reboots (jcaamano)

  > Customers may need to change the MTU post-installation. However these changes
  > aren't trivial and may cause downtime, hence Cluster Network Operator currently
  > forbids them.
  >
  > This enhancement proposes an automated procedure launched on demand and
  > coordinated by the Cluster Network Operator. This procedure is based on draining
  > and rebooting the nodes sequentially after performing the required configuration
  > changes to minimize service disruption and to ensure that the
  > nodes have a healthy configuration and that workloads preserve connectivity
  > during and after the procedure.

- [969](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/969): (2/2) update: enhancements/update: Set OWNERS for update-focused enhancements (wking)

  > Folks on the core-updates teams will be interested reviewers.  @LalatenduMohanty  (team lead) and @sdodson  (local staff engineer) are likely to approve things in this space, after weighing feedback from the updates team and the wider organization.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 8 Other New pull requests:

- [962](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/962): (132/132) windows-containers: WINC-505: Windows containerd runtime enablement (selansen)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > This enhancement intends to allow customers to bring up Windows node with containerd
  > as default runtime from OpenShift 4.11 onwards. When customers upgrade clusters to
  > OpenShift 4.11, CRI runtime will be migrated from Docker to containerd

- [971](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/971): (4/4) insights: WIP Insights Operator pulling and updating pull-secret (transferring uncl… (tremes)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > This enhancement will enable the Insights Operator to pull the updated `pull-secret` (from the OCM API)
  > and that will enable cluster ownership transfer. Currently, the ownership transfer is a two step process
  > which involves initiating the transfer from the OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM) API
  > and then updating the global `pull-secret` on the cluster with the new owner’s `pull-secret`.
  > If the `pull-secret` is not changed on the cluster within 5 days, the ownership transfer is canceled
  > and needs to be initiated again.
  > This process applies to all scenarios that require cluster ownership transferred across Red Hat accounts.
  >
  > The intent is to simplify the cluster ownership process to a one step process.

- [972](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/972): (2/2) general: Upstream Repository Resync EP (josefkarasek)

  > This enhancement will reduce the time spent on syncing downstream repositories with their upstreams.
  > It aims to automate repetitive activities and leave only the creative/intellectual work, such as
  > conflict resolution, to repository maintainers.
