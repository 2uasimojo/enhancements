*Updates since 2022-03-18*


## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized New pull request:

- [1067](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1067): (171/171) agent-installer: Automated Workflow for Agent-based Installer (dhellmann)

  `do-not-merge/hold, priority/important-soon`

  > "Cluster 0" deployments, for the first cluster in an environment, are
  > unique because they occur in situations where there may not be a lot
  > of other infrastructure to support long-running services normally
  > associated with automated provisioning for on-premises use
  > cases. Nevertheless, users and partners want to automate these
  > deployments. The assisted installer GUI provides an excellent user
  > experience for manually deploying clusters. This enhancement covers
  > the *automation* use case.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 6 Other Merged pull requests:

- [980](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/980): (3/88) authentication: enhancements/authentication: detect invalid certificates (s-urbaniak)

  > OpenShift 4.10 is going to be rebased against Kubernetes 1.23. This requires using Go 1.17.
  > However, starting with Go 1.17 the support for the CommonName field of server HTTPS certificates is going to be removed.
  >
  > Formally, the temporary `GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0` flag [has been removed](https://go.dev/doc/go1.17#crypto/x509).
  > This implies that starting from OpenShift 4.10 invalid certificates will not be trusted any more as they will fail verification.
  >
  > Example:
  >
  > Given the following certificate:
  > ```plaintext
  > Certificate:
  >     Data:
  >         ...
  >         Subject: CN=foo-domain.com
  >         X509v3 extensions:
  >             X509v3 Key Usage: critical
  >                 Digital Signature, Key Encipherment
  >             X509v3 Extended Key Usage:
  >                 TLS Web Server Authentication
  >             X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical
  >                 CA:FALSE
  > ```
  >
  > Verification against the `foo-domain.com` hostname of such certificate will fail with the following error in Go 1.17:
  > ```plaintext
  > x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs instead
  > ```
  >
  > Verification of server certificates is executed during the TLS Handshake procedure.
  > A TLS (https) client observing an invalid certificate will reject the connection attempt.
  >
  > Cluster internal issued certificates are not affected,
  > however custom certificates can be configured in various cases:
  > - custom serving certificates for kube-apiserver
  > - custom API webhooks
  > - custom aggregated API endpoints
  > - custom certificates for route endpoints
  > - certificates of external auth identity providers
  >
  > This will lead to broken connections to critical core parts of OpenShift and thus to a degraded cluster if invalid custom certificates are configured.
  >
  > This enhancement suggests a solution to prevent core workloads involving
  > invalid certificates, functional on OpenShift 4.9, to break upon the upgrade to
  > OpenShift 4.10. It therefore proposes:
  > - a way to detect invalid certificates in kube-apiserver and oauth-server
  > - a way to prevent upgrades from OpenShift 4.9 to OpenShift 4.10 in the face of invalid certificates

- [995](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/995): (4/232) machine-api: Add enhancement for AWS Placement Groups in Machine API (JoelSpeed)

  > This enhancement describes the process of integrating [AWS Placement Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#placement-groups-partition)
  > into the OpenShift Machine API.
  >
  > Placement Groups allow users to define how groups of Machines should be placed within the Availability Zone.
  > For example, they can be clustered together within the same network spine, or separated for redundancy.

- [1002](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1002): (5/101) ingress: CFE-10: Add host-network-bind-options (Elbehery)

  > This enhancement aims to enable reuse of the same nodes by 2 or more Ingress Controllers with `HostNetwork` endpoint strategy without running into port reuse conflicts.
  > This is done by allowing configuration of the ports used by the router pods within the Ingress Controller API specification.

- [1028](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1028): (6/16) cluster-logging: flow-control-api spec (pmoogi-redhat)

  > If the log collector cannot keep up with the rate that logs are written, some logging data will be lost.
  > Lack of  flow control these problems:
  > * Hard to predict and impossible to control the volume of logs.
  > * No control over which logs get lost.
  > * During an outage, log buffers build up without user control.
  >   This can cause long recovery times and very high latency when the connection is restored.
  >
  > This proposal defines an API to let cluster administrators to limit logging rates, or ignore some logs entirely.
  > Logs may still be lost if the collector cannot keep up, but administrators have more control over *what* is lost,
  > and more predictability of log rates.

- [1063](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1063): (37/38) installer: add stage-based exit codes to the openshift-installer (deads2k)

  > `openshift-installer` callers will now get more granular exit codes.
  > Callers of `openshift-installer` can expect non-zero exit codes *that may change over time* as
  > the `openshift-installer` evolves over time.
  > `openshift-installer` provides *no guarantee* that exit codes will not change as result of changes like
  > greater granularity, lower granularity, re-organization, or other needs.
  > `openshift-installer` *does guarantee* that a particular exit code will not be re-used to have a
  > different meaning in the same y-level version.
  > `openshift-installer` will make reasonable efforts to avoid re-using a particular exit code to have
  > different meanings across y-level versions, but for sufficiently compelling reasons may do so.

- [1069](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1069): (27/27) dev-guide: Add notes to explain how API fields should be documented in conventions (JoelSpeed)

  > As an API reviewer, I would like to see thorough documentation added to new API fields so that I can understand the mechanics of the changes we are adding to our API and so that customers can understand how they can and can't use the new fields.
  >
  > To encourage better documentation on ur APIs, I think we should add some notes to the conventions prompting users with a number of questions to think about when writing their godoc and some examples of how this might look in practice.
  >
  > This is a first draft of this to gather initial feedback:
  > - Is this the right location for this kind of content?
  > - What other questions should users be asked when writing their godoc
  > - Do we have any other recommendations about godoc that aren't already noted
  >
  > ToDo:
  > - [x] Add more examples of where the godoc is used
  > - [x] Provide example of godoc output for examples to help authors understand what the user might see
  > - [x] Clarify any language guidance we have for writing these godoc (Eg should we follow product doc styling)
  > - [x] Confirm we want to split out an official API conventions/style guide

- [1071](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1071): (4/4) baremetal: Add bootstrap-external-ip (honza)

  > When installing a bare metal IPI cluster, you can use the `networkConfig` field
  > in the `install-config.yaml` file to configure the control plane network
  > interfaces for the cluster hosts.  However, currently, you cannot configure the
  > bootstrap VM networking using the same means.
