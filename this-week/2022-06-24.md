- [1125](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1125): (13/61) agent-installer: AGENT-40: Enhancement for generating admin kubeconfig (zaneb) ([AGENT-40](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AGENT-40))

  > We will generate the admin kubeconfig file in the agent installer at the same
  > time as the agent ISO. The CA keys used to sign the client certificate in the
  > kubeconfig will be added to the ISO and eventually installed into the cluster
  > so that the credentials in the admin kubeconfig will be accepted.

- [981](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/981): (3/166) general: Added proposal for HyperShift monitoring. (bwplotka) ([MON-1877](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MON-1877))

  > This proposal aims to figure our monitoring case of HyperShift topology. There are three important parts of this proposal:
  >
  > For HyperShift Admin, we propose to extract metric storage, alerting and querying for Clusters managed by HyperShift to a separate service that can be scaled, deployed and managed in a decoupled mode. This will allow robust multi-cluster, fleet monitoring with best experience possible for cluster admins.
  > This means SD org, running managed HyperShift will use the RHOBS managed by Observability Group and AppSRE. Metrics from control planes of hosted clusters will be shipped thanks to Monitoring Stacks.
  >
  > The data plane part of guest clusters requires changes too. In terms of feature parity for users custom or UWM monitoring and HPA we propose to deploy unchanged CMO for smallest changes possible. We also propose using CMO path to gather and send needed monitoring data for HyperShift Admin to RHOBs as well as data-plane telemetry through the usual path.

- [1066](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1066): (6/49) dev-guide: Document the various event files produced by CI (DennisPeriquet)
- [1127](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1127): (44/53) general: Proposal for hiding container mountpoints from systemd (lack) ([CNF-5326](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNF-5326))

  > The current implementation of Kubelet and CRI-O both use the top-level
  > namespace for all container and Kubelet mountpoints. However, moving these
  > container-specific mountpoints into a private namespace reduced systemd
  > overhead with no difference in functionality.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 7 Other New pull requests:

- [1153](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1153): (23/23) update: Enhancement to refine ClusterVersion history pruning (jottofar) ([OTA-664](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OTA-664))

  `lgtm, approved, do-not-merge/hold`

  > CVO currently maintains a 50 entry queue of installed versions.
  > Once the queue is full CVO simply removes the first added entry.
  > The intent of the pruner as modified by this [commit][commit] was to remove the first added partial update entry, if one exists, otherwise to simply remove the first entry.
  > Even once [rhbz#2097067][rhbz-2097067] is fixed this can result in the removal of useful cluster version information such as the initial installed version.
  > Because some things such as install-time infrastructure depend on the initial version, we want to preserve that entry.
  > There are additional history entries which should be given preference when determining which entry to remove.
  > This enhancement defines a more intelligent history pruning algorithm with the goal of keeping the more informative history entries, as defined below.
  > In addition, the history queue will be expanded to 100 entries.

- [1158](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1158): (60/60) general: Ingress node firewall support using eBPF proposal (msherif1234) ([SDN-2781](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-2781))

  > OCP customers would like to secure OCP's nodes from external DDoS attacks by configuring ingress firewall policies.
  > eBPF provides very flexible filtering mechansim to allow early detection and filtering for a wide range of protocols IPv4/IPv6/ICMP/TCP/UDP/ICMPv6/SCTP.
  >
  > New cluster scoped CRD `IngressNodeFirewall` will be used to configure node ingress firewall match rules and a per matching rule statistics will be avaliable.
