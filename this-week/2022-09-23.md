There was 1 Prioritized Merged pull request:

- [1239](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1239): (2/70) installer: Installer: Feature Sets (patrickdillon) ([CORS-2253](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CORS-2253))

  > This enhancement proposes adding support for feature sets to `openshift-install`.
  > Users would be able to enable feature sets at install time. The Installer would support all feature sets in the OpenShift API,
  > and write the selected Feature Set to the cluster.


### Prioritized Active Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [1237](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1237): (30/121) microshift: Add MicroShift Default CSI Plugin proposal (copejon) ([USHIFT-41](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/USHIFT/issues/USHIFT-41))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > This enhancement proposes the adoption of a
  > default [Container Storage Interface(CSI) Plugin](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/)for Microshift. For more
  > details on MicroShift, see the respective [proposal](./kubernetes-for-device-edge.md). Kubernetes' CSI implementation
  > provides a standardized model for exposing block and file storage systems to container workloads.

- [918](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/918): (16/267) installer: vsphere: add multiple datacenter and clusters (jcpowermac) ([SPLAT-320](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SPLAT-320))

  `priority/important-soon`

  > The goal of this enhancement is to provide the ability to install in a
  > vSphere environment with multiple datacenters and clusters.
  >
  > This will be an opinionated design, the vCenter datacenter will always be a `region`
  > and a vCenter cluster will always be a `zone`.

There were 5 Other Merged pull requests:

- [1126](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1126): (2/60) cluster-logging: Logs-based alerts (periklis) ([LOG-2510](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2510))

  > This document proposes a solution and a delivery plan for pushing logs-based alerts from OpenShift Logging Loki to Cluster-Monitoring AlertManager. It complements the existing [user-workload monitoring stack][uwm-docs] and [alerting stack][alerting-docs], enabling a full self-service experience for platform and workload logs-based monitoring.

- [1233](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1233): (7/10) hypershift: AUTH-311: hypershift: add an enhancement on trust separation (stlaz) ([AUTH-311](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AUTH-311))

  > At the time of writing the Hypershift is generating most of its certificates
  > by using a single trust-all root CA. This enhancement describes how and why
  > such a bundle should be split in order to assure workload portability between
  > OpenShift-based products.
