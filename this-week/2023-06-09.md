- [1417](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1417): (19/19) multi-arch: Support for Multiarch Manager Operator (Prashanth684) ([MIXEDARCH-215](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MIXEDARCH-215))

  > Recently, cloud vendors have started offering compute nodes leveraging different
  > CPU architectures. With the rising use and support of multi-architecture compute
  > nodes in Openshift clusters, users and cluster administrators face new
  > challenges when deploying workloads. Primarily, the scheduler does not consider
  > the images' compatibility with the CPU architectures when filtering nodes. We
  > must assume that the images used for deploying workloads would only support some
  > architecture the cluster could consist of. The typical workaround is to manually
  > add affinities to the pod spec to ensure that the pods land on nodes where the
  > image binaries can be executed. This strongly impacts the user experience: it
  > couples the set of compatible architectures at a given point in time to the pod
  > spec, does not scale well, and is challenging to maintain. The
  > `multiarch-manager-operator` aims to automate the inspection of the container
  > images, derive a set of architectures supported by a pod and use it to
  > automatically define strong predicates based on the `kubernetes.io/architecture`
  > label in the pod's nodeAffinity.

- [1419](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1419): (17/17) cluster-logging: Fine grained logs access (aminesnow) ([LOG-4020](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4020))

  > This enhancement proposal seeks to outline the solution for a more fine grained access to LokiStack logs on OpenShift Container Platform 4, ie, have the ability as the cluster administrator to grant access to logs on a namespace basis.
  >
  > The proposal provides an overview of the changes required to achieve this goal as well as some implementation details.

- [1421](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1421): (3/3) general: Shared and Guaranteed CPU Pools (bartwensley) ([CNF-8759](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNF-8759))

  > This enhancement describes an approach to split the single CPU pool currently used by kubernetes into two
  > partitions (shared and guaranteed). The guaranteed partition will be used exclusively for containers with
  > the guaranteed QoS that consume whole CPUs. This will allow special kernel configuration to be applied to
  > this set of CPUs, to enable low latency applications (e.g. 5G RAN vDU), without affecting other applications
  > running on the same server.
