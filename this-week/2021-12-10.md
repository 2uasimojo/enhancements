- [921](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/921): (1/105) general: Enhancement proposal for Network Observability (stleerh)

  > Network Observability introduces a new category in OpenShift that
  > provides networking information for a single cluster.  It gives insight
  > into what's on the network, when and what types of traffic and traffic
  > flows are being made, and by whom.  It gathers data to help design, plan,
  > and answer questions about the network and provides a visual representation
  > to help understand, diagnose, and troubleshoot networking issues.

### Other New Changes

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Other New pull requests:

- [977](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/977): (3/3) worker-latency-profile: Add WorkerLatencyProfile enhancement (harche)

  > To make sure the Openshift cluster keeps running optimally where network latency between the control plane and the worker nodes may not always be at its best (e.g. Edge cases), we can tweak the frequency of the status updates done by the `Kubelet` and the corresponding reaction times of the `Kube Controller Manager` and `Kube API Server`.

- [980](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/980): (21/21) authentication: enhancements/authentication: detect invalid certificates (s-urbaniak)

  > OpenShift 4.10 is going to be rebased against Kubernetes 1.23. This requires using Go 1.17.
  > However, starting with Go 1.17 support for legacy invalid is going to be removed, see https://go.dev/doc/go1.17.
  > More formally, the temporary `GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0` flag has been removed.
  > This implies that starting from OpenShift 4.10 invalid certificates will not be trusted any more
  > as they will fail verification.
  >
  > This enhancement suggests a solution to prevent broken workloads from OpenShift 4.9 to OpenShift 4.10
  > if invalid certificates are detected.
  >
  > This enhancment therefore proposes:
  > - a way to detect invalid certificates in kube-apiserver and oauth-server
  > - a way to prevent upgrades from OpenShift 4.9 to OpenShift 4.10 in the face of invalid certificates

- [981](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/981): (60/60) general: Added proposal for HyperShift monitoring. (bwplotka)

  > We propose to extract metric storage, alerting and querying to a separate service that can be scaled, deployed and managed in a decoupled mode. This will allow robust multi-cluster, fleet monitoring with best experience possible for cluster admins. This means SD org, running managed HyperShift will use RHOBS managed by Observability Group and AppSRE.
