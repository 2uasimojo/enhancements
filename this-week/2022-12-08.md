- [1229](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1229): (6/13) hypershift: PSAP-742: Enable node tuning of HyperShift hosted nodes via NTO (dagrayvid) ([PSAP-742](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/PSAP-742))

  > This enhancement describes how the [Node Tuning Operator (NTO)](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-node-tuning-operator) will run in HyperShiftâ€™s managed control plane to manage tuning of hosted cluster nodes via the containerized TuneD daemon.
  > The required changes can be summarized into the following three phases.
  >
  > Phase 1: Enable NTO to be used for setting sysctls via TuneD and managing default tunings applied to hosted cluster nodes:
  > - HyperShift repo:
  >   - Enable deploying NTO in the control plane namespace via the control-plane-operator. NTO will have two kubeconfigs for accessing the hosted and management clusters.
  >   - Add `spec.tuningConfig` field to the NodePool API. Similarly to the `spec.config` field, it will be a list of references to ConfigMaps in which Tuned manifests are stored.
  >   - Reconcile `spec.tuningConfig` in the NodePool controller. Embed the Tuned configuration into a ConfigMap per NodePool in the control plane namespace.
  > - Node Tuning Operator repo:
  >   - NTO needs to support the option of having two kubeconfigs
  >   - NTO needs to know whether it is running in HyperShift (based on env variable)
  >   - When running in HyperShift, NTO needs to get Tuneds from the ConfigMap(s) in the hosted control-plane namespace and create the Tuned objects in the hosted cluster (reconciling the Tuneds in the Hosted Cluster to always match those in the ConfigMap(s))
  >   - NTO needs to create the operand (containerized TuneD daemon) and Profile objects in the Hosted Cluster.
  >
  > Phase 2: Enable NTO to be used for setting kernel boot arguments calculated by TuneD on hosted cluster nodes
  > - HyperShift repo:
  >   - Watch and reconcile NTO-generated (by the operator) ConfigMaps containing MachineConfigs for setting kernel parameters.
  > - Node Tuning Operator repo:
  >   - Change NTO to embed generated MachineConfigs for setting kernel parameters into ConfigMaps with a specific label that will get picked up by the NodePool controller.
  >   - Change NTO to label these ConfigMaps by NodePool.
  >
  > Phase 3 (4.13+): Enable Performance Addon Operator / PerformanceProfile controller functionality.
  > In OCP 4.11 the Performance Addon Operator -- which is owned by the CNF team -- has been merged into the Node Tuning Operator, as a separate controller running under the same binary.

  > This enhancement describes how certificate authorities for image registries
  > should be distributed to CRI-O, openshift-apiserver, and other clients when the

- [1296](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1296): (29/29) ingress: Enhancement Proposal for Adding HTTP header to HAProxy Without Customizing haproxy.config Template (miheer) ([NE-982](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-982))

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > This enhancement extends the IngressController logging API and router API to allow the user to set
  > capture of HTTP headers in the haproxy.config file. Using the new API, users may specify a list of
  > HTTP headers either via IngressController API or Route API that should be set in the haproxy.config file.

- [1297](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1297): (5/5) general: SDN-3613: Ingress node firewall flood attack enhancement (msherif1234) ([SDN-3408](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDN-3408))

  `do-not-merge/hold`

  > OCP customers would like to secure OCP's nodes from external Flood attacks are
  > also known as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
  > In a flood attack, attackers send a very high volume of traffic to a system so
  > that it cannot examine and allow permitted network traffic.
  > For example, an ICMP flood attack occurs when a system receives too many ICMP
  > ping commands and must use all its resources to send reply commands.
  >
  > Ingress Node Firewall will protect against these types of flood attacks
  > - ICMP/ICMPv6
  > - SYN
  > - UDP

- [1298](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1298): (3/3) monitoring: Scrape Profiles (JoaoBraveCoding)

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > The core OpenShift components ship a large number of metrics. A 4.12-nightly
  > cluster on AWS currently produces around 350K series by default, and enabling
  > additional add-ons increases that number. Users have repeatedly asked for a supported
  > method of making Prometheus consume less memory, either by increasing the scraping
  > timeout (which is a direction we would not like to follow) or by scraping fewer targets
  > -- for example modifying the ServiceMonitors to drop metrics undesired to users.
  >
  > These modifications are currently not possible, because the service monitors deployed to OCP
  > are managed by operators and cannot be modified.
  > This proposal outlines a solution for allowing users to set a level of scraping aligned with their needs.
