- [1412](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1412): (4/46) general: AUTH-387: auth: add enhancement for unsupported direct kube-apiserver oidc config (stlaz)

  > This PR adds an enhancement that debates configuring an OIDC provider directly with the kube-apiserver with unsupportedConfigOverrides.
  >
  > It adds a study where Keycloak was configured this way and how it influenced some basic components function.
  >
  > /cc @deads2k
  > /assign @openshift/openshift-team-auth

- [1461](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1461): (2/110) general: OCPCLOUD-1910: Installing Cluster API components in OpenShift (damdo) ([OCPCLOUD-1910](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPCLOUD-1910))

  > This enhancement describes how we (the Cluster Infrastructure team) intend to rework the current flow for the installation of Cluster API components in OpenShift, at the moment only available in Tech Preview, by addressing some of the criticalities of the current implementation, leveraging some of the lessons learned since the first Tech Preview release.
  >
  > The focus areas of this refactor are mainly around reducing complexity of the architecture and improving the development, stability and maintainability of Standalone Cluster API on OpenShift by preventing payload breakage due to non atomic repository merges, while maintaining the functionality provided up until now.

- [1471](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1471): (6/64) storage: STOR-1454: merge CSI driver operators (jsafrane) ([STOR-1437](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/STOR-1437))

  > CSI driver operators are OCP specific operators that install and manage CSI drivers shipped by OCP either as part of
  > payload or as optional operators installed by OLM.
  >
  > In this document we propose that all these operators are compiled from a single git repository, as they're mostly
  > copy-paste.

There were 5 New pull requests:

- [1490](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1490): (17/17) machine-config: MCO-811: MCO State Reporting (cdoern) ([MCO-452](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MCO-452))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > This enhancement describes how Nodes and their upgrade processes should be aggregated by the MCO into a user facing object. Alongside this, MCO component progression should be aggregated into the machineconfiguration operator/v1 object. The goal here is to allow customers and the MCO team to decipher the our processes in a more verbose way, speeding up the debugging process and allowing for
  > better customer engagement.

- [1492](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1492): (23/23) update: OTA-1029: Add CVO Log level API (Davoska) ([OTA-1029](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OTA-1029))

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress, jira/valid-reference`

  > This enhancement describes the API changes needed to provide a simple way of dynamically changing the Cluster Version Operator's log level.

- [1493](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1493): (26/26) authentication: HOSTEDCP-1240: WIP: auth: add an enhancement on a supported direct OIDC config (stlaz) ([HOSTEDCP-1240](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/HOSTEDCP-1240))

  `jira/valid-reference`

  > This enhancement describes how to allow configuring OIDC directly as the main
  > source of identities in an OpenShift cluster.

- [1494](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1494): (2/2) observability-ui: add observability ui operator proposal (jgbernalp) ([OU-204](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OU-204))

  > This proposal introduces the Observability UI Operator, a tool designed to manage UI plugins related to observability signals within the OpenShift console. By centralizing the management of such plugins, we can offer a unified observability experience in the console and accommodate new use cases, all while decoupling UI responsibilities from other operators.
